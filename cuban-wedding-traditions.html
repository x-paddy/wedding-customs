                <p><strong>The Cuban civil ceremony</strong> is a legally required government proceeding established after the 1959 Revolution, lasting 20-30 minutes with 10-15 attendees at a cost of $50-$200 USD.</p>

                <h3>Las Arras (The 13 Wedding Coins Tradition)</h3>
                <p><strong>Las arras</strong> is a Spanish colonial tradition where the groom presents 13 gold coins (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-monedas-2867"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ES-CU_monedas.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="monedas - click to hear pronunciation" lang="ES"><strong class="term-text">monedas</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moh-NEH-dahs</span></span></span></dfn>/moh-NEH-dahs) to the bride, symbolizing Christ and the 12 apostles, with coins costing $200-$1,000 USD.</p>
                <p>The ceremony involves:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Priest blesses coins</strong> during the service</li>
                <li><strong>Groom pours coins</strong> into bride&rsquo;s cupped hands</li>
                <li><strong>Bride keeps 12 coins</strong> in special box (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-cofre-3218"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ES-CU_cofre.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="cofre - click to hear pronunciation" lang="ES"><strong class="term-text">cofre</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KOH-freh</span></span></span></dfn>/KOH-freh)</li>
                <li><strong>13th coin goes</strong> in bride&rsquo;s right shoe for prosperity</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This tradition appears in 85% of Catholic Cuban weddings and 60% of all Cuban ceremonies. Modern couples sometimes use family heirloom coins passed down through generations, adding sentimental value worth far more than monetary cost. The priest often says &ldquo;Recibe estas arras&rdquo; (reh-SEE-beh EHS-tahs AH-rrahs - receive these coins) during the blessing.</p>

                <h3>Are Cuban destination weddings legal?</h3>
                <p><strong>Cuban destination weddings</strong> require specific legal procedures, with foreign couples needing to complete civil ceremonies for legal recognition. Required documents include: birth certificates, divorce decrees if applicable, single status affidavits, and translations by certified Cuban translators costing $50-$200 per document. Processing takes 3-7 business days. Many couples complete legal ceremonies in their home country, then hold symbolic celebrations in Cuba. Wedding planners handle bureaucracy for $500-$1,500 service fees.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a traditional Cuban wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Cuban weddings run $10,000-$50,000 USD total, with average celebrations for 150-200 guests costing $20,000-$30,000 USD. Here&#x27;s the honest breakdown: civil ceremony ($50-$200 USD because bureaucracy is cheap), religious ceremony ($500-$2,000 USD for God&#x27;s blessing), reception venue ($3,000-$10,000 USD for space to party until dawn), catering at $30-$100 USD per guest (no one leaves hungry—ever), live band ($2,000-$8,000 USD because DJs are for quinceañeras), and classic car rentals ($200-$500 USD for that Havana feeling). Cuban weddings in actual Cuba cost about 40% less than Cuban-American weddings stateside, but involve 300% more paperwork. Pro tip: whatever budget you set, add 25% for the inevitable &quot;we need more rum&quot; situations and your mother-in-law&#x27;s last-minute guest additions.</p>
                <h3>What is La Hora Loca in a Cuban wedding?</h3>
                <p>La Hora Loca (Crazy Hour) is a carnival-style celebration that occurs around midnight during Cuban wedding receptions, featuring masks, props, and high-energy music for 30-60 minutes.</p>
                <h3>What should guests wear to a Cuban wedding?</h3>
                <p>Fashion at Cuban weddings balances &quot;look amazing&quot; with &quot;survive 12 hours of dancing in tropical heat.&quot; Women rock cocktail dresses or elegant sundresses in fabrics that breathe—think linen, cotton, or anything that won&#x27;t turn you into a sweaty mess by hour three. Avoid white, ivory, or anything that might upstage the bride (she&#x27;s already stressed enough). Men sport lightweight suits or dress pants with guayaberas(Cuban formal shirts), because showing up in a heavy wool suit is basically announcing you&#x27;ve never been to a Cuban party. For beach venues, dressy sandals work, but churches demand closed-toe shoes—God has standards. Evening receptions require comfortable dancing shoes because you WILL be dancing, whether you know how or not. That friend who says &quot;I don&#x27;t dance&quot;? They&#x27;ll be leading the conga line by midnight.</p>
                <h3>How long does a traditional Cuban wedding celebration last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Cuban weddings typically span multiple days, with pre-wedding ceremonies, the main celebration lasting 6-8 hours, and post-wedding gatherings like La Tornaboda.</p>

                <p>Cuban weddings don&#x27;t last—they endure. These marathon celebrations traditionally span 2-3 days, with the main reception lasting 8-12 hours minimum. Here&#x27;s your survival timeline: 2 PM ceremony (arrive fashionably late), 3 PM cocktail hour with enough appetizers to count as lunch, 5 PM dinner (pace yourself), 7 PM first dances (phones out for videos), midnight la hora loca(organized chaos), 2 AM late-night food because dancing burns calories, 4-6 AM final farewell (maybe). The next day&#x27;s tornaboda(recovery brunch) adds another 3-4 hours of reliving the highlights while nursing hangovers with café cubano strong enough to raise the dead. Some hardcore celebrations include pre-wedding parties that effectively turn one wedding into a long weekend festival. Sleep is for the weak and non-Cubans.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of Las Arras in Cuban weddings?</h3>
                <p>Las Arras consists of 13 gold coins presented by the groom to the bride, symbolizing Christ and the 12 apostles, representing shared prosperity and trust.</p>
                <h3>What gifts are appropriate for Cuban weddings?</h3>
                <p>Cuban wedding gifts follow one golden rule: cash is king. During el baile del dinero(money dance), guests pin bills directly on the couple—average $50-$200 USD per couple, more if you&#x27;re family or trying to impress someone. While modern couples might have registries, most prefer efectivo(cash) because it&#x27;s practical and doesn&#x27;t require thank-you notes for a blender they&#x27;ll never use. Traditional gifts include quality household items (think espresso makers that could survive nuclear war), decorative pieces (but tasteful—no tourist shop flamingos), or contributions to the honeymoon fund (usually via envelope with a nice card). Godparents typically give religious items or substantial cash gifts of $500-$2,000 USD because being a padrino(godparent) is expensive. Never give knives (cuts relationships), handkerchiefs (brings tears), or anything yellow (nobody remembers why, but don&#x27;t risk it).</p>
                <h3>Are civil ceremonies required for Cuban weddings?</h3>
                <p>Yes, civil ceremonies (Ceremonia Civil) are legally mandatory in Cuba and must occur before any religious ceremony, lasting 20-30 minutes with close family present.</p>
                <h3>Can non-Cuban couples have a Cuban-themed wedding?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Cuban-themed weddings for non-Cuban couples work beautifully when done with respect and authenticity, not like a tourist&#x27;s fever dream. The key is incorporating genuine elements: hire actual Cuban musicians or DJs who know the difference between salsa and merengue (hint: it matters), serve authentic Cuban food prepared by people who learned from their abuelas, and include fun traditions like la hora loca(crazy hour) without appropriating religious elements you don&#x27;t understand. Skip the fake Spanish accents and plastic maracas—nobody needs that. Consider hiring a Cuban wedding planner who can guide you toward cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. The best Cuban-themed weddings capture the joy, music, and family focus of Cuban culture while respecting its depth. Remember: Cubans are generally thrilled when others appreciate their culture, just don&#x27;t wear a fake mustache and call it &quot;authentic.&quot;</p>
                <h3>What is La Pedida de Mano?</h3>
                <p>La Pedida de Mano is a formal marriage request ceremony where the groom&#x27;s family asks for the bride&#x27;s hand in marriage, typically occurring 6-12 months before the wedding.</p>
                <h3>What is the typical Cuban wedding menu?</h3>
                <p>The typical Cuban wedding menu reads like a love letter to carbohydrates and pork, centering on lechón asado(roasted pig) that&#x27;s been marinating since the engagement party. Essential dishes include moros y cristianos(black beans and rice) that everyone fights over the crispy bottom part, yuca con mojo(cassava with enough garlic to ward off vampires), and tostones(fried plantains) that disappear faster than your dignity during la hora loca. Appetizers feature croquetas(croquettes) and empanadas that could solve world peace if shared properly. Desserts showcase flan (mandatory), tres leches cake (also mandatory), and pastelitos(pastries) filled with guava or cheese. The wedding cake is usually rum-soaked with tropical fruit fillings because why have boring cake? Late-night fuel includes Cuban sandwiches and caldo gallego(hearty soup) because at 3 AM, you need sustenance to keep dancing. Portions are calculated assuming each guest hasn&#x27;t eaten in a week and might not eat again for another.</p>
                <h3>What type of music is played at Cuban weddings?</h3>
                <p>Cuban weddings feature a progression of music styles, starting with formal danzón, moving to traditional son cubano, and ending with energetic salsa and modern hits.</p>
                <h3>Do Cuban weddings have bridal parties?</h3>
                <p>Cuban weddings skip the matching bridesmaid dress disasters in favor of a more practical system. Instead of color-coordinated squads, couples choose padrinos y madrinas(godparents)—usually an older married couple who serve as spiritual guides, wisdom dispensers, and emergency dance partners. These aren&#x27;t your average witnesses; they&#x27;re like wedding consultants who&#x27;ve already survived marriage and lived to tell about it. The damas(ladies) and caballeros(gentlemen) might participate in the ceremony but wear whatever makes them look good, saving everyone $150-$300 USD on ugly matching outfits they&#x27;ll never wear again. This system prevents the drama of choosing between cousins, avoids the &quot;always a bridesmaid&quot; complex, and ensures someone responsible is involved in planning. Plus, padrinos often cover significant wedding expenses, so they&#x27;re basically sponsors with speaking roles. Modern couples sometimes blend both traditions, having a small bridal party and padrinos, because why not complicate things?</p>
                <h3>What is the purpose of La Muñeca tradition?</h3>
                <p>La Muñeca is a wedding doll dressed like the bride, placed at the head table to absorb negative energy and protect the couple during their celebration.</p>
                <h3>What music is played at Cuban weddings?</h3>
                <p>Cuban wedding music follows a strategic progression designed to build energy like a masterfully mixed cocktail—starting smooth and ending with everyone sweating on the dance floor. The journey begins with formal danzón during the ceremony (classy), moves to son cubano during cocktails (hips start moving), shifts to romantic boleros during dinner (couples get nostalgic), then explodes into salsa, timba(Cuban funk-salsa hybrid), and merengue until dawn. Modern DJs seamlessly blend classics like &quot;El Cuarto de Tula&quot; with Bad Bunny, creating multigenerational dance floors where abuelas teach millennials proper hip movement. Essential songs include &quot;La Vida es un Carnaval&quot; (required by law), &quot;Guantanamera&quot; (tourists love it), and whatever Celia Cruz recording makes your mom cry. Live bands typically know 100+ songs spanning five decades because Cuban musicians apparently don&#x27;t need sheet music or breaks. By 3 AM, someone&#x27;s definitely requested &quot;Despacito&quot; and been rightfully shamed.</p>
                <h3>How much does a typical Cuban wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Cuban weddings vary widely in cost, with destination weddings ranging from $10,000-$50,000 for 50-150 guests, including ceremonies, reception, and entertainment.</p>
                <h3>Are Cuban destination weddings legal?</h3>
                <p>Cuban destination weddings require navigating more red tape than a government office gift-wrapping service. Foreign couples must complete Cuba&#x27;s civil ceremony for legal recognition, requiring: birth certificates (translated and notarized), divorce decrees if applicable (also translated, also notarized), single status affidavits (swearing you&#x27;re not secretly married elsewhere), passport copies (multiple, because why not), and translations by certified Cuban translators ($50-$200 USD per document, depending on their mood). Processing takes 3-7 business days if the stars align and the office has working printers. Smart couples complete legal ceremonies in their home country, then hold symbolic celebrations in Cuba where the only requirement is having a good time. Wedding planners charge $500-$1,500 USD just to handle bureaucracy, which is money well spent unless you enjoy spending honeymoon time in government offices. Pro tip: bring extra copies of everything, patience of a saint, and small bills for &quot;expediting&quot; services.</p>
                <h3>What happens during El Baile del Dinero?</h3>
                <p>El Baile del Dinero (Money Dance) involves guests pinning money on the couple while dancing, typically raising $1,000-$5,000 to help start their new life together.</p>
                <h3>What are the must-have Cuban wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>The non-negotiable Cuban wedding traditions create the perfect storm of culture, celebration, and controlled chaos. Las arras(13 coins ceremony) symbolizes prosperity and gives photographers that money shot (literally). El baile del dinero(money dance) funds your future while ensuring face time with every guest who&#x27;s pinning twenties on your dress. La hora loca(crazy hour) transforms dignified guests into carnival participants through strategic distribution of props and peer pressure. Live Cuban music throughout the reception because recorded music is for car rides, not celebrations. Traditional feast with lechón(roasted pork) as centerpiece—vegetarian options exist but are viewed with suspicion. El brindis(toasts) honoring both families equally, preventing diplomatic incidents. Classic car transportation for photos that scream &quot;Cuba!&quot; louder than a tourist in Havana. Celebrations lasting until sunrise with strategic café cubano stations for survival. These elements combined cost $5,000-$8,000 USD but create the authentic atmosphere that makes Cuban weddings legendary. Skip any of these and risk the ultimate punishment: your guests leaving before 2 AM.</p>
                <h3>What is La Tornaboda?</h3>
                <p>La Tornaboda is an intimate day-after celebration for 30-50 close family and friends, featuring traditional Cuban breakfast foods and reflecting on wedding memories.</p>

<script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a traditional Cuban wedding cost?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Cuban weddings run $10,000-$50,000 USD total, with average celebrations for 150-200 guests costing $20,000-$30,000 USD. Here's the honest breakdown: civil ceremony ($50-$200 USD because bureaucracy is cheap), religious ceremony ($500-$2,000 USD for God's blessing), reception venue ($3,000-$10,000 USD for space to party until dawn), catering at $30-$100 USD per guest (no one leaves hungry—ever), live band ($2,000-$8,000 USD because DJs are for quinceañeras), and classic car rentals ($200-$500 USD for that Havana feeling). Cuban weddings in actual Cuba cost about 40% less than Cuban-American weddings stateside, but involve 300% more paperwork. Pro tip: whatever budget you set, add 25% for the inevitable \"we need more rum\" situations and your mother-in-law's last-minute guest additions."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is La Hora Loca in a Cuban wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "La Hora Loca (Crazy Hour) is a carnival-style celebration that occurs around midnight during Cuban wedding receptions, featuring masks, props, and high-energy music for 30-60 minutes."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What should guests wear to a Cuban wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Fashion at Cuban weddings balances \"look amazing\" with \"survive 12 hours of dancing in tropical heat.\" Women rock cocktail dresses or elegant sundresses in fabrics that breathe—think linen, cotton, or anything that won't turn you into a sweaty mess by hour three. Avoid white, ivory, or anything that might upstage the bride (she's already stressed enough). Men sport lightweight suits or dress pants with guayaberas(Cuban formal shirts), because showing up in a heavy wool suit is basically announcing you've never been to a Cuban party. For beach venues, dressy sandals work, but churches demand closed-toe shoes—God has standards. Evening receptions require comfortable dancing shoes because you WILL be dancing, whether you know how or not. That friend who says \"I don't dance\"? They'll be leading the conga line by midnight."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does a traditional Cuban wedding celebration last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Cuban weddings typically span multiple days, with pre-wedding ceremonies, the main celebration lasting 6-8 hours, and post-wedding gatherings like La Tornaboda."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do Cuban weddings last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban weddings don't last—they endure. These marathon celebrations traditionally span 2-3 days, with the main reception lasting 8-12 hours minimum. Here's your survival timeline: 2 PM ceremony (arrive fashionably late), 3 PM cocktail hour with enough appetizers to count as lunch, 5 PM dinner (pace yourself), 7 PM first dances (phones out for videos), midnight la hora loca(organized chaos), 2 AM late-night food because dancing burns calories, 4-6 AM final farewell (maybe). The next day's tornaboda(recovery brunch) adds another 3-4 hours of reliving the highlights while nursing hangovers with café cubano strong enough to raise the dead. Some hardcore celebrations include pre-wedding parties that effectively turn one wedding into a long weekend festival. Sleep is for the weak and non-Cubans."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the significance of Las Arras in Cuban weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Las Arras consists of 13 gold coins presented by the groom to the bride, symbolizing Christ and the 12 apostles, representing shared prosperity and trust."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What gifts are appropriate for Cuban weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban wedding gifts follow one golden rule: cash is king. During el baile del dinero(money dance), guests pin bills directly on the couple—average $50-$200 USD per couple, more if you're family or trying to impress someone. While modern couples might have registries, most prefer efectivo(cash) because it's practical and doesn't require thank-you notes for a blender they'll never use. Traditional gifts include quality household items (think espresso makers that could survive nuclear war), decorative pieces (but tasteful—no tourist shop flamingos), or contributions to the honeymoon fund (usually via envelope with a nice card). Godparents typically give religious items or substantial cash gifts of $500-$2,000 USD because being a padrino(godparent) is expensive. Never give knives (cuts relationships), handkerchiefs (brings tears), or anything yellow (nobody remembers why, but don't risk it)."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are civil ceremonies required for Cuban weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, civil ceremonies (Ceremonia Civil) are legally mandatory in Cuba and must occur before any religious ceremony, lasting 20-30 minutes with close family present."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can non-Cuban couples have a Cuban-themed wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Absolutely! Cuban-themed weddings for non-Cuban couples work beautifully when done with respect and authenticity, not like a tourist's fever dream. The key is incorporating genuine elements: hire actual Cuban musicians or DJs who know the difference between salsa and merengue (hint: it matters), serve authentic Cuban food prepared by people who learned from their abuelas, and include fun traditions like la hora loca(crazy hour) without appropriating religious elements you don't understand. Skip the fake Spanish accents and plastic maracas—nobody needs that. Consider hiring a Cuban wedding planner who can guide you toward cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. The best Cuban-themed weddings capture the joy, music, and family focus of Cuban culture while respecting its depth. Remember: Cubans are generally thrilled when others appreciate their culture, just don't wear a fake mustache and call it \"authentic.\""}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is La Pedida de Mano?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "La Pedida de Mano is a formal marriage request ceremony where the groom's family asks for the bride's hand in marriage, typically occurring 6-12 months before the wedding."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the typical Cuban wedding menu?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The typical Cuban wedding menu reads like a love letter to carbohydrates and pork, centering on lechón asado(roasted pig) that's been marinating since the engagement party. Essential dishes include moros y cristianos(black beans and rice) that everyone fights over the crispy bottom part, yuca con mojo(cassava with enough garlic to ward off vampires), and tostones(fried plantains) that disappear faster than your dignity during la hora loca. Appetizers feature croquetas(croquettes) and empanadas that could solve world peace if shared properly. Desserts showcase flan (mandatory), tres leches cake (also mandatory), and pastelitos(pastries) filled with guava or cheese. The wedding cake is usually rum-soaked with tropical fruit fillings because why have boring cake? Late-night fuel includes Cuban sandwiches and caldo gallego(hearty soup) because at 3 AM, you need sustenance to keep dancing. Portions are calculated assuming each guest hasn't eaten in a week and might not eat again for another."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What type of music is played at Cuban weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban weddings feature a progression of music styles, starting with formal danzón, moving to traditional son cubano, and ending with energetic salsa and modern hits."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Cuban weddings have bridal parties?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban weddings skip the matching bridesmaid dress disasters in favor of a more practical system. Instead of color-coordinated squads, couples choose padrinos y madrinas(godparents)—usually an older married couple who serve as spiritual guides, wisdom dispensers, and emergency dance partners. These aren't your average witnesses; they're like wedding consultants who've already survived marriage and lived to tell about it. The damas(ladies) and caballeros(gentlemen) might participate in the ceremony but wear whatever makes them look good, saving everyone $150-$300 USD on ugly matching outfits they'll never wear again. This system prevents the drama of choosing between cousins, avoids the \"always a bridesmaid\" complex, and ensures someone responsible is involved in planning. Plus, padrinos often cover significant wedding expenses, so they're basically sponsors with speaking roles. Modern couples sometimes blend both traditions, having a small bridal party and padrinos, because why not complicate things?"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the purpose of La Muñeca tradition?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "La Muñeca is a wedding doll dressed like the bride, placed at the head table to absorb negative energy and protect the couple during their celebration."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What music is played at Cuban weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban wedding music follows a strategic progression designed to build energy like a masterfully mixed cocktail—starting smooth and ending with everyone sweating on the dance floor. The journey begins with formal danzón during the ceremony (classy), moves to son cubano during cocktails (hips start moving), shifts to romantic boleros during dinner (couples get nostalgic), then explodes into salsa, timba(Cuban funk-salsa hybrid), and merengue until dawn. Modern DJs seamlessly blend classics like \"El Cuarto de Tula\" with Bad Bunny, creating multigenerational dance floors where abuelas teach millennials proper hip movement. Essential songs include \"La Vida es un Carnaval\" (required by law), \"Guantanamera\" (tourists love it), and whatever Celia Cruz recording makes your mom cry. Live bands typically know 100+ songs spanning five decades because Cuban musicians apparently don't need sheet music or breaks. By 3 AM, someone's definitely requested \"Despacito\" and been rightfully shamed."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a typical Cuban wedding cost?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Cuban weddings vary widely in cost, with destination weddings ranging from $10,000-$50,000 for 50-150 guests, including ceremonies, reception, and entertainment."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are Cuban destination weddings legal?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cuban destination weddings require navigating more red tape than a government office gift-wrapping service. Foreign couples must complete Cuba's civil ceremony for legal recognition, requiring: birth certificates (translated and notarized), divorce decrees if applicable (also translated, also notarized), single status affidavits (swearing you're not secretly married elsewhere), passport copies (multiple, because why not), and translations by certified Cuban translators ($50-$200 USD per document, depending on their mood). Processing takes 3-7 business days if the stars align and the office has working printers. Smart couples complete legal ceremonies in their home country, then hold symbolic celebrations in Cuba where the only requirement is having a good time. Wedding planners charge $500-$1,500 USD just to handle bureaucracy, which is money well spent unless you enjoy spending honeymoon time in government offices. Pro tip: bring extra copies of everything, patience of a saint, and small bills for \"expediting\" services."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What happens during El Baile del Dinero?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "El Baile del Dinero (Money Dance) involves guests pinning money on the couple while dancing, typically raising $1,000-$5,000 to help start their new life together."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are the must-have Cuban wedding traditions?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The non-negotiable Cuban wedding traditions create the perfect storm of culture, celebration, and controlled chaos. Las arras(13 coins ceremony) symbolizes prosperity and gives photographers that money shot (literally). El baile del dinero(money dance) funds your future while ensuring face time with every guest who's pinning twenties on your dress. La hora loca(crazy hour) transforms dignified guests into carnival participants through strategic distribution of props and peer pressure. Live Cuban music throughout the reception because recorded music is for car rides, not celebrations. Traditional feast with lechón(roasted pork) as centerpiece—vegetarian options exist but are viewed with suspicion. El brindis(toasts) honoring both families equally, preventing diplomatic incidents. Classic car transportation for photos that scream \"Cuba!\" louder than a tourist in Havana. Celebrations lasting until sunrise with strategic café cubano stations for survival. These elements combined cost $5,000-$8,000 USD but create the authentic atmosphere that makes Cuban weddings legendary. Skip any of these and risk the ultimate punishment: your guests leaving before 2 AM."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is La Tornaboda?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "La Tornaboda is an intimate day-after celebration for 30-50 close family and friends, featuring traditional Cuban breakfast foods and reflecting on wedding memories."}}]}</script>
