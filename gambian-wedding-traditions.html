<p><strong>Gambian wedding traditions</strong> are multi-day celebrations that blend Islamic customs with ethnic-specific rituals from the Mandinka (42% of population), Fula (18%), and Wolof (16%) communities, typically lasting 3-7 days and involving 200-500 guests. These traditions encompass pre-wedding negotiations, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kola-1102"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-GM_kola.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kola - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">kola</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KOH-lah</span></span></span></dfn> nut ceremonies (wo_ko-la-nut), religious ceremonies, traditional music, and elaborate feasts, creating celebrations that cost between 50,000-300,000 Gambian Dalasi ($800-$5,000 USD).</p>

                <p><strong>The kola nut proposal</strong> is a centuries-old West African marriage tradition where a man formally declares his intent to marry by sending kola nuts to the woman&rsquo;s family, symbolizing respect, unity, and healing in the relationship. This initial gesture typically costs D500-D2,000 ($8-$30 USD) and involves 10-20 kola nuts presented through family intermediaries.</p>
                <p>The kola nut ceremony process includes:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Selection phase</strong>: Man identifies suitable family (1-2 weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>Messenger appointment</strong>: 2-3 male elders chosen as representatives</li>
                <li><strong>Initial presentation</strong>: Kola nuts delivered with formal greetings</li>
                <li><strong>Family consultation</strong>: Woman&rsquo;s family discusses proposal (3-7 days)</li>
                <li><strong>Acceptance ritual</strong>: Kola nuts accepted or returned</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In modern Gambian society, 78% of marriages still begin with kola nut proposals, particularly in rural areas where traditional practices remain strong. Urban couples may modify the tradition by including the kola nuts alongside modern engagement rings worth D5,000-D50,000 ($80-$800 USD).</p>
                <h3>Family Negotiations and Dowry Discussions</h3>
                <p><strong>Family negotiations</strong> (mn_saf-al) are formal meetings between representatives of both families that occur 2-4 weeks after kola nut acceptance, establishing dowry amounts, wedding dates, and ceremonial arrangements. These negotiations typically involve 4-8 family elders and last 2-4 hours per session.</p>
                <p>Traditional dowry components include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash payment</strong>: D10,000-D100,000 ($150-$1,500 USD)</li>
                <li><strong>Livestock</strong>: 1-3 cows (D15,000-D25,000 each)</li>
                <li><strong>Clothing sets</strong>: 5-10 complete outfits (D2,000-D5,000 per set)</li>
                <li><strong>Jewelry</strong>: Gold sets worth D5,000-D30,000</li>
                <li><strong>Household items</strong>: Kitchen equipment and furniture</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Contemporary negotiations often incorporate the bride&rsquo;s educational background and career status, with educated brides&rsquo; families sometimes requesting lower dowries to reflect modern values. Approximately 65% of urban families now include the couple in final negotiation stages.</p>

                <p><strong>Ngoomar</strong> (wo_ngo-mar) is a pre-wedding celebration held the evening before the wedding ceremony, traditionally lasting from 6 PM until dawn and involving 50-150 participants from both families. This centuries-old tradition costs D5,000-D20,000 ($80-$300 USD) for food, entertainment, and venue arrangements.</p>
                <p>Traditional Ngoomar elements:</p>

                <li><strong>Griot performances</strong>: Professional storytellers charge D2,000-D5,000</li>

                <li><strong>Midnight feast</strong>: Traditional foods for all attendees</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern Ngoomar celebrations in urban areas often feature DJ services (D5,000-D15,000), Western music alongside traditional performances, and social media documentation. However, 72% of families maintain at least 2-3 traditional elements within contemporary celebrations.</p>

                <p><strong>The Nikah</strong> (ar_ni-kah) is an Islamic marriage contract ceremony performed in mosques by certified Imams, required for the 90% Muslim majority in The Gambia and typically conducted on Friday afternoons between 2-4 PM.

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Elder selection</strong>: Most respected family member chosen</li>
                <li><strong>Blessing recitation</strong>: Prayers for fertility and prosperity</li>
                <li><strong>Breaking ritual</strong>: Kola nut split into pieces</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution order</strong>: Imam first, then elders by seniority</li>
                <li><strong>Community sharing</strong>: All attendees receive pieces</li>
                <li><strong>Celebration announcement</strong>: Marriage declared official</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each distributed piece symbolizes the couple&rsquo;s commitment to share life&rsquo;s bitterness and sweetness. The ritual requires 20-40 kola nuts (D500-D1,000) and represents the binding of two families into one extended network.</p>
                <h3>Christian Wedding Ceremonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Christian weddings</strong> in The Gambia serve the 8% Christian population, primarily Aku (Krio) communities, with ceremonies conducted in churches lasting 60-90 minutes and costing D20,000-D100,000 ($300-$1,500 USD). These weddings typically occur on Saturdays between 10 AM-2 PM.</p>
                <p>Distinctive Christian wedding features:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Courtship period</strong>: 6-18 months of open dating</li>
                <li><strong>Church requirements</strong>: Pre-marital counseling (4-8 sessions)</li>

                <h3>Proxy Marriage Procedures</h3>
                <p><strong>Proxy marriage</strong> (ar_ni-kah-bil-wa-ka-la) is a legally recognized marriage ceremony where one partner, typically working abroad, is represented by an appointed proxy during the wedding ceremony. This practice serves approximately 15% of Gambian marriages involving diaspora members.</p>
                <p>Legal requirements for proxy marriages:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Power of attorney</strong>: Notarized document required</li>
                <li><strong>Proxy selection</strong>: Adult male relative preferred</li>
                <li><strong>Consent verification</strong>: Video/phone confirmation</li>
                <li><strong>Embassy attestation</strong>: For international cases</li>
                <li><strong>Registration deadline</strong>: Within 30 days of ceremony</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Proxy marriages cost an additional D5,000-D15,000 ($80-$250 USD) for legal documentation and international communication. The absent partner typically returns within 3-12 months for traditional celebration ceremonies with extended family.</p>

                <p><strong>Evening refreshments</strong> served from 8 PM-2 AM include traditional beverages and snacks sustaining guests through extended celebrations, costing D10,000-D25,000 ($150-$400 USD) for 200-300 people. These refreshments are essential for all-night festivities.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Traditional Bath Rituals and Purification</h3>
                <p><strong>Post-wedding bath rituals</strong> (wo_sang-al) occur on specific days following the ceremony, involving herbal preparations costing D1,000-D3,000 and requiring 2-3 elderly women specialists to perform ceremonial cleansing. These rituals mark important transitions in the bride&rsquo;s marital journey.</p>
                <p>Traditional bath sequence:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Wedding night bath</strong>: White clothing ceremony</li>

                <li><strong>Special occasion baths</strong>: Pregnancy, births</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each bath uses specific herbs believed to ensure fertility (D500-D1,500 per preparation), marital harmony, and protection from ill wishes. Modern brides may simplify to 2-3 key baths while maintaining symbolic significance.</p>
                <h3>Wife&rsquo;s First Cooking Ceremony</h3>
                <p><strong>The first cooking ceremony</strong> (mn_tog-al-fo-lo) occurs 7-10 days after marriage when the bride prepares her first meal in the husband&rsquo;s home, using ingredients worth D2,000-D5,000 provided by her mother. This ritual demonstrates the bride&rsquo;s household capabilities and formally establishes her domestic role.</p>
                <p>Ceremonial cooking requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Pounded couscous</strong>: Made with drumming accompaniment</li>

Contemporary versions may involve symbolic cooking with catered supplements for larger gatherings.</p>
                <h3>Newlywed Visitation Schedule</h3>
                <p><strong>Post-wedding visitations</strong> follow a structured timeline over 3-6 months, strengthening bonds between families through reciprocal hospitality costing each household D5,000-D15,000 per major visit. These visits involve 10-20 family members and specific gift exchanges.</p>
                <p>Traditional visitation timeline:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Bride&rsquo;s parents visit newlyweds</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2</strong>: Return visit to bride&rsquo;s family</li>
                <li><strong>Month 1</strong>: Extended family rounds begin</li>

                <li><strong>Year 1</strong>: Anniversary celebration planning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern couples may compress visitation schedules due to work commitments, sometimes combining multiple visits into weekend gatherings. However, first parental visits remain priority with 89% compliance rates.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Mandinka Wedding Traditions (42% of Population)</h3>
                <p><strong>Mandinka weddings</strong> represent the largest ethnic group&rsquo;s traditions, featuring distinctive mat presentation ceremonies and beaded calabash gifts, with celebrations typically involving 300-500 guests and costing D75,000-D200,000 ($1,200-$3,000 USD).

                <h3>Wolof Wedding Traditions (16% of Population)</h3>
                <p><strong>Wolof weddings</strong> feature elaborate <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sabar-1227"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_sabar.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Sabar - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">Sabar</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sah-BAR</span></span></span></dfn> drumming ceremonies and distinctive white grand mbubu attire, with celebrations emphasizing sophisticated social hierarchies and costing D60,000-D180,000 ($900-$2,700 USD). The Wolof maintain rigid caste considerations in marriage arrangements.</p>
                <p>Wolof-specific customs:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Caste considerations</strong>: Matching social levels required</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Contemporary Wolof weddings increasingly downplay caste restrictions while maintaining cultural aesthetics. Mixed Wolof marriages with other ethnicities occur in 38% of urban unions.</p>
                <h3>Fula Wedding Traditions (18% of Population)</h3>
                <p><strong>Fula weddings</strong> showcase dramatic red-themed celebrations with distinctive shoulder-carrying processions, typically involving 200-300 guests and costing D50,000-D150,000 ($750-$2,250 USD). These celebrations emphasize pastoral heritage and musical traditions.</p>
                <p>Unique Fula elements:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Red dominance</strong>: All ceremonial clothing and decorations</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder procession</strong>: 2-kilometer groom carrying bride</li>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Integration of Western Wedding Elements</h3>
                <p><strong>Western-style wedding elements</strong> now appear in 65% of urban Gambian weddings, adding components like white wedding gowns (D20,000-D100,000), multi-tiered cakes (D5,000-D20,000), and formal photography packages (D15,000-D50,000). These additions typically increase wedding budgets by 40-60%.</p>
                <p>Common Western adoptions:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>White weddings</strong>: Separate church/garden ceremonies</li>
                <li><strong>Reception venues</strong>: Hotels and event centers</li>
                <li><strong>Formal invitations</strong>: Printed cards (D50-D200 each)</li>

                <li><strong>Honeymoons</strong>: 20% now include travel plans</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Couples often schedule traditional ceremonies on Friday and Western-style celebrations on Saturday, creating hybrid weekend weddings. This dual approach satisfies both cultural preservation and modern aspirations.</p>
                <h3>Diaspora Wedding Innovations</h3>
                <p><strong>Diaspora influences</strong> affect 30% of Gambian weddings through returned migrants or international family connections, introducing elements like destination weddings, livestreaming services (D5,000-D15,000), and fusion menus. Proxy marriages serve 15% of diaspora-connected unions.</p>
                <p>Diaspora-driven changes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology integration</strong>: WhatsApp wedding groups</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-location ceremonies</strong>: Gambia plus abroad</li>

                <li><strong>Documentary videos</strong>: Beyond traditional photography</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Return celebrations for diaspora couples average D100,000-D300,000, often exceeding local wedding costs due to international guest expectations and elevated service standards.</p>
                <h3>Social Media and Digital Influences</h3>
                <p><strong>Social media presence</strong> influences 80% of weddings among couples under 35, with professional photography/videography packages ranging D20,000-D60,000 and dedicated wedding hashtags creating digital archives. Instagram and TikTok shape aesthetic choices and guest expectations.</p>
                <p>Digital age adaptations:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-wedding shoots</strong>: Themed photography sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Live streaming</strong>: For distant relatives (D5,000-D10,000)</li>

                <p>Social media pressure increases average wedding budgets by 25-35% as couples seek &ldquo;Instagram-worthy&rdquo; moments. Traditional elements often receive special documentation focus for cultural preservation purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>Family compounds</strong> (wo_kunda) remain the preferred venue for 55% of traditional ceremonies, accommodating 200-500 guests in courtyard spaces at minimal cost beyond decorations (D5,000-D20,000) and tent rentals (D10,000-D30,000).

                <p>Compound wedding logistics:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Space preparation</strong>: 2-3 days cleaning and setup</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Rural compounds offer more space but may require infrastructure improvements. Urban compounds face space constraints, leading to street closure permits (D1,000-D2,000) for expanded celebration areas.</p>

                <p><strong>Mosques</strong> host 75% of Muslim wedding ceremonies with facilities accommodating 50-200 people and charging D2,000-D10,000 in usage fees plus Imam honorariums. Churches serve Christian minorities with capacity for 100-400 guests at D5,000-D20,000 rental costs.</p>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Booking timelines</strong>: 2-3 months advance for popular sites</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity limitations</strong>: Gender separation requirements</li>

                <h3>Civil Registration Requirements</h3>
                <p><strong>Civil marriage registration</strong> costs D500-D2,000 at district tribunals and must occur within 30 days of ceremonies to ensure legal recognition, with penalties of D5,000-D10,000 for late registration. Only 60% of marriages achieve timely registration due to awareness and accessibility issues.</p>
                <p>Registration process requirements:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Application forms</strong>: Both parties complete</li>
                <li><strong>Identity documents</strong>: Passports or ID cards</li>
                <li><strong>Witness statements</strong>: Two per party required</li>
                <li><strong>Marriage certificate</strong>: From religious ceremony</li>
                <li><strong>Registration fee</strong>: Paid at tribunal</li>
                <li><strong>Processing time</strong>: 5-10 business days</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Urban areas show 75% registration compliance versus 45% in rural regions. Mobile registration services during wedding seasons improve accessibility in remote areas.</p>
                <h3>Islamic Law and Cadi Courts</h3>
                <p><strong>Islamic law</strong> governs 90% of Gambian marriages through Cadi courts that handle marriage contracts, divorce proceedings, and inheritance matters with filing fees of D200-D1,000. These courts operate alongside civil systems creating legal pluralism.</p>
                <p>Cadi court jurisdiction covers:</p>
                <ul>

                <li><strong>Inheritance division</strong>: Islamic law application</li>
                <li><strong>Polygamy regulations</strong>: Second wife permissions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern challenges include harmonizing Islamic and civil law requirements, particularly regarding women&rsquo;s rights and international recognition of marriages for visa purposes.</p>
                <h3>Customary Law Recognition</h3>
                <p><strong>Customary law</strong> marriages receive legal recognition when not &ldquo;repugnant to natural justice&rdquo; and account for 40% of rural unions, particularly among traditionalist communities. These marriages may lack formal documentation but gain validity through community recognition.</p>
                <p>Customary marriage elements:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Community witnesses</strong>: Elder testimonies suffice</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional ceremonies</strong>: Replace formal contracts</li>
                <li><strong>Oral agreements</strong>: Binding within communities</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible dowries</strong>: Negotiated by custom</li>
                <li><strong>Dispute resolution</strong>: Elder mediation preferred</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation challenges</strong>: For official purposes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Legal reforms increasingly encourage documentation of customary marriages for protection of spousal rights, particularly regarding property and inheritance matters affecting women and children.</p>

            <h2 class="accordion">FAQs</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Gambian wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Gambian weddings cost between D50,000-D300,000 ($800-$5,000 USD) depending on guest numbers, venue choices, and ceremony elaborateness. Urban weddings average D150,000 while rural celebrations may cost D75,000. Major expenses include dowry payments (D10,000-D100,000), food for 200-500 guests (D30,000-D100,000), traditional attire (D20,000-D60,000), and entertainment (D10,000-D30,000).</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kola-494"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-GM_kola.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kola - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">kola</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KOH-lah</span></span></span></dfn> nuts in Gambian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Kola nuts serve as the traditional marriage proposal symbol in Gambian culture, representing respect, unity, and healing between families. The initial kola nut presentation costs D500-D2,000 and involves 10-20 nuts delivered by male elders. The &ldquo;breaking of the kola nut&rdquo; ceremony during the wedding officially seals the marriage union when pieces are distributed among 50-100 attendees, symbolizing shared blessings and community approval.</p>
                <h3>How long do Gambian wedding celebrations typically last?</h3>
                <p>Gambian weddings traditionally span 3-7 days, including pre-wedding preparations, main ceremonies, and post-wedding rituals. The timeline includes: <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ngoomar-1207"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_ngoomar.mp3" data-definition="bachelor&amp;rsquo;s eve" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Ngoomar - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">Ngoomar</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">n-GOH-mar</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-ngoomar-1207" class="definition-inline">bachelor&amp;rsquo;s eve</span></dfn>, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nikah-1239"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-GM_nikah.mp3" data-definition="religious ceremony" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Nikah - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Nikah</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nee-KAH</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-nikah-1239" class="definition-inline">religious ceremony</span></dfn>, reception celebrations (1-2 days), and post-wedding visitations (extending over several weeks). Modern urban weddings may compress to 2-3 days while maintaining essential ceremonies.</p>
                <h3>Can couples have both traditional and Western-style weddings?</h3>
                <p>Yes, approximately 65% of urban Gambian couples incorporate both traditional and Western elements. Typically, traditional Islamic or customary ceremonies occur on Friday, followed by Western-style receptions on Saturday. This dual approach costs 40-60% more than traditional-only weddings but satisfies both cultural preservation and modern preferences. Couples often change between traditional attire and Western wedding clothes during celebrations.</p>
                <h3>What are the main differences between ethnic wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Each ethnic group has distinctive customs: Mandinka weddings feature black attire and mat presentation ceremonies; Fula traditions include red clothing and shoulder-carrying processions; Wolof ceremonies emphasize white grand mbubu garments and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sabar-2305"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_sabar.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Sabar - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">Sabar</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sah-BAR</span></span></span></dfn> drumming. These variations reflect historical identities while modern inter-ethnic marriages increasingly blend traditions from multiple cultures.</p>
                <h3>Is proxy marriage legal and common in The Gambia?</h3>
                <p>Proxy marriage is legally recognized under Islamic law and serves approximately 15% of marriages involving diaspora members. The process requires notarized power of attorney, costs an additional D5,000-D15,000 for documentation, and allows weddings when one partner works abroad. The absent partner typically returns within 3-12 months for celebration ceremonies with extended family.</p>
                <h3>What foods are essential at a Gambian wedding feast?</h3>
                <p>Traditional wedding menus must include <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-benachin-3017"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_benachin.mp3" data-definition="Jollof rice" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="benachin - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">benachin</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ben-ah-SHEEN</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-benachin-3017" class="definition-inline">Jollof rice</span></dfn> requiring 50kg rice for 200 people, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-domoda-3076"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MN-GM_domoda.mp3" data-definition="peanut stew" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="domoda - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MN"><strong class="term-text">domoda</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">doh-MOH-dah</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-domoda-3076" class="definition-inline">peanut stew</span></dfn>, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-yassa-3098"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_yassa.mp3" data-definition="grilled chicken" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="yassa - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">yassa</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">yah-SAH</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-yassa-3098" class="definition-inline">grilled chicken</span></dfn>, and morning porridge with milk. Beverages include <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-wonjo-3173"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/WO-GM_wonjo.mp3" data-definition="hibiscus" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="wonjo - click to hear pronunciation" lang="WO"><strong class="term-text">wonjo</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">won-JOH</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-wonjo-3173" class="definition-inline">hibiscus</span></dfn>, baobab juice, and ginger beer totaling 150-200 liters for typical gatherings. Food costs range D30,000-D100,000 with preparation beginning at 4 AM involving 20-30 women cooks.</p>
                <h3>How do modern Gambian couples modify traditional customs?</h3>
                <p>Contemporary modifications include condensed timelines (2-3 days versus traditional 7 days), selective tradition adoption, professional services replacing family labor, and technology integration like livestreaming (D5,000-D15,000). However, 78% maintain core elements like kola nut ceremonies, religious rites, and family negotiations while adapting peripheral customs to modern lifestyles.</p>
                <h3>What role does religion play in Gambian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Religion fundamentally shapes Gambian weddings with 90% following Islamic traditions requiring Nikah ceremonies in mosques, gender-separated celebrations, and alcohol-free receptions. Christian weddings (8% of marriages) occur in churches with Western-influenced receptions. Interfaith marriages (12%) carefully negotiate ceremonial elements from both traditions, often holding separate religious ceremonies.</p>
                <h3>What should international guests know about attending Gambian weddings?</h3>
                <p>International guests should prepare for 3-7 day celebrations, gender-separated seating at traditional ceremonies, communal eating customs using right hands, and gift-giving expectations (D500-D5,000 cash or household items). Modest dress is required, particularly at religious ceremonies. Expect late-night festivities until dawn, abundant food hospitality, and participation in traditional dances and games.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
