                <h3>What Are Turks and Caicos Pre-<a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-traditions-around-the-world">Wedding Customs</a>?</h3>
                <p><strong>Pre-<a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-traditions-around-the-world">wedding traditions</a> in Turks and Caicos</strong> are destination-specific customs that developed from the islands&rsquo; 48-hour residency requirement and include professional wedding planning consultations, arrival welcome events, and personal venue tours that typically begin 2-3 days before the ceremony.</p>
                <h3>Wedding Planning Consultations</h3>
                <p><strong>Wedding planning consultations</strong> are essential pre-wedding services that became standard practice in the 1990s as <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-providenciales-718"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-TC_providenciales.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Providenciales - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">Providenciales</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">prov-ih-den-see-AH-lays</span></span></span></dfn> developed into a major wedding destination. This tradition involves:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Local expertise</strong>: Professional planners who manage vendor relationships ($1,500-$5,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Legal navigation</strong>: Assistance with marriage license requirements and documentation</li>
                <li><strong>Site selection</strong>: Knowledge of 12+ ceremony <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-beaches-1095"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-TC_beaches.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="beaches - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">beaches</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">BEE-chez</span></span></span></dfn> and 50+ reception venues</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline coordination</strong>: Managing the 48-hour residency requirement effectively</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As wedding specialists note: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly recommended that you work with a local wedding planner to help manage all aspects of the event&rdquo; since they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;know who&rsquo;s reliable and where to find everything.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Arrival and Welcome Events</h3>
                <p><strong>The 48-hour arrival tradition</strong> is a legal requirement that visitors must be present in Turks and Caicos for at least 48 hours before applying for a marriage license, established under British colonial administration. This centuries-old requirement has evolved into:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Welcome receptions</strong>: Sunset sailings ($150-$300 per person)</li>
                <li><strong>Beach bonfires</strong>: Evening gatherings on <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-grace-bay-1970"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-TC_grace_bay.mp3" data-definition="$500-$1,500" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Grace Bay - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">Grace Bay</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">GRACE bay</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-grace-bay-1970" class="definition-inline">$500-$1,500</span></dfn></li>
                <li><strong>Island tours</strong>: Introduction to local culture and venues</li>
                <li><strong>Guest activities</strong>: Snorkeling, catamaran trips, beach time</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Modern practice</strong>: 85% of couples now extend stays to 5-7 days, turning the legal requirement into multi-day celebrations that showcase different beaches, restaurants, and island experiences.</p>
                <h3>Venue Selection Tours</h3>
                <p><strong>Venue selection tours</strong> are personalized visits to potential ceremony and reception sites conducted 2-3 days before the wedding. This tradition includes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Beach assessment</strong>: Evaluating wind patterns, privacy, and sun position</li>
                <li><strong>Grace Bay Beach</strong>: 12-mile stretch visited by 90% of couples</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative sites</strong>: Governor&rsquo;s Beach, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-leeward-2841"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-TC_leeward.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Leeward - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">Leeward</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LEE-werd</span></span></span></dfn> Beach, private cays</li>
                <li><strong>Timing considerations</strong>: Optimal ceremony times between 4-6 PM</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most popular site, Grace Bay Beach on Providenciales, features powdery white sand and turquoise waters, making it &ldquo;one of the most beautiful places to get married&rdquo; with over 500 ceremonies annually.</p>

                <li>Single status affidavit or divorce decree</li>
                <li>Death certificate if widowed</li>
                <li><strong>License fees</strong>:</li>
                <li>Standard application: $150 USD (after 48-hour residency)</li>
                <li>Special cruise ship license: $250 USD (same-day)</li>

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How long before the wedding should we arrive in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>Arrive at least 48 hours before your wedding date to complete legal requirements, though 3-5 days is recommended for a more relaxed experience and pre-wedding activities.</p>
                <h3>What documents are required for a legal wedding in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>You&#x27;ll need valid passports, birth certificates, proof of single status, and any divorce/death certificates if applicable. Documents must be original or certified copies.</p>
                <h3>What is the average cost of a wedding planner in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>Wedding planners typically charge between $1,500-$5,000, depending on service level and event complexity.</p>
                <h3>Can we have a religious ceremony in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>Yes, religious ceremonies are available across Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist denominations, with 40% of couples choosing this option.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s the best time of year for a Turks and Caicos wedding?</h3>
                <p>December through April offers the best weather, with lower humidity and rainfall. However, May-November can offer better rates and fewer tourists.</p>
                <h3>Is the &#x27;barefoot ceremony&#x27; tradition mandatory?</h3>
                <p>While not mandatory, 90% of beach weddings incorporate this tradition as it adds to the authentic island experience.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s included in a typical &#x27;Weddingmoon&#x27; package?</h3>
                <p>Weddingmoon packages typically include the ceremony, reception, accommodation, and honeymoon activities over 7-10 days.</p>
                <h3>How many guests can I invite to a Turks and Caicos wedding?</h3>
                <p>Most venues accommodate 20-150 guests, with beach ceremonies typically hosting 50-75 guests.</p>
                <h3>Are underwater wedding photos included in typical photography packages?</h3>
                <p>Underwater photography is usually an add-on service, typically costing $500-$1,500 extra.</p>
                <h3>What backup plans are available for weather issues?</h3>
                <p>Most resorts and planners include indoor backup venues, with 30% of receptions requiring covered alternatives during peak season.</p>
                <h3>Do we really have to wait 48 hours before getting married in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>The 48-hour rule is actually your friend in disguise! Yes, it&#x27;s a real legal requirement—you must be physically present in the Turks and Caicos Islands for at least 48 hours before you can apply for a marriage license. But here&#x27;s what they don&#x27;t tell you in the fine print: this &quot;waiting period&quot; transforms into the best pre-wedding party you never knew you needed.
Most couples (about 85%) extend their stay to 5-7 days anyway, turning bureaucracy into beach time. Think sunset catamaran welcomes ($150-$300 USD per person), beach bonfires on Grace Bay ($500-$1,500 USD), and giving your wedding party time to actually bond over rum punch and conch(konk) fritters. The rule exists because of British colonial law, but it&#x27;s become such a beloved part of the experience that couples who could legally marry elsewhere still choose the islands specifically for this built-in celebration time. Pro tip: arrive Tuesday or Wednesday since government offices close on weekends!</p>
                <h3>What happens if it rains during our beach ceremony?</h3>
                <p>Great question—and one every couple googles at 2 AM! The reality is that Turks and Caicos enjoys 350 days of sunshine annually, but smart couples always have a Plan B. About 30% of beach receptions end up using their weather backup, though &quot;rain&quot; here usually means a 20-minute tropical shower, not an all-day washout.
Most venues automatically include an indoor backup option in your contract. Resorts like Beaches Turks &amp; Caicos or The Palms(the PALMS) have gorgeous covered pavilions that maintain ocean views while keeping guests dry. Private villa weddings might move to covered terraces or great rooms with those massive sliding doors that blur indoor/outdoor lines. Some couples embrace it—one December wedding had a 10-minute shower during the ceremony, and the photographer captured incredible shots of the couple kissing under a shared umbrella while guests cheered. The bride later said it was her favorite moment because &quot;everyone was laughing instead of crying, and my hair looked amazing all dewy.&quot; Weather insurance runs about $300-$500 USD and covers vendor rescheduling costs if needed.</p>
                <h3>How much does a typical Turks and Caicos wedding actually cost?</h3>
                <p>The answer spans wider than Grace Bay Beach itself! A typical celebration runs $10,000-$30,000 USD, but let&#x27;s break that down into real numbers you can work with. Intimate elopements (just the couple plus witnesses) start around $3,000-$5,000 USD including officiant, photographer, and basic beach setup. Small weddings (20-40 guests) average $10,000-$15,000 USD, while larger celebrations (60-150 guests) push into that $20,000-$30,000 USD range.
Your biggest expenses: venue/reception ($150-$500 USD per guest), photography ($2,000-$6,000 USD), and coordination ($1,500-$5,000 USD). Beach ceremony setups run $500-$2,000 USD depending on complexity. Want to save? Consider May-November&#x27;s off-season rates (30-40% lower), limit your guest list (every couple you cut saves $300-$1,000 USD), or choose a smaller island like Salt Cay where everything costs less. Splurge zones: private island venues like COMO Parrot Cay(KOH-moh PAIR-ut kay), extended photography with underwater sessions, and premium bar packages. Remember to budget for guest activities—those group catamaran trips and snorkeling excursions add up but create the memories everyone talks about years later.</p>
                <h3>Can Jewish, Hindu, or Muslim couples have religious ceremonies in Turks and Caicos?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely, though it requires more planning than the Christian ceremonies that dominate the islands&#x27; 92% Christian population. Jewish couples regularly bring visiting rabbis from Chabad Lubavitch($1,000-$2,500 USD plus travel expenses) who perform ceremonies under chuppahs decorated with tropical flowers instead of traditional roses. Several couples have created beautiful beach ceremonies incorporating Jewish traditions—one memorable wedding featured a seaside ketubah signing at sunset.
Hindu ceremonies present unique opportunities to blend traditions with tropical settings. While there&#x27;s no Hindu temple on the islands, visiting priests can perform ceremonies on the beach. The sacred fire ceremony adapts beautifully to beach settings with proper windscreens. One couple created a stunning mandap using bamboo and bougainvillea(boo-gan-VIL-ee-ah) on Grace Bay Beach. Muslim couples often arrange for visiting imams, with the nikah ceremony performed at private villas or resort pavilions. The key for all non-Christian ceremonies: start planning 6-8 months ahead to coordinate visiting clergy, ensure proper ceremony items can be imported (some religious items require customs documentation), and remember that the legal civil ceremony must happen first—religious ceremonies are considered blessings that follow the official marriage.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s this &quot;Weddingmoon&quot; thing and is it worth it?</h3>
                <p>The Weddingmoon is Turks and Caicos&#x27; genius solution to the eternal question: &quot;Why leave paradise for a honeymoon?&quot; Instead of packing up after your reception and flying somewhere else, you seamlessly transition from wedding to honeymoon without changing resorts. And yes, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it for most couples!
Here&#x27;s how it works: Days 1-4 might be wedding festivities with your guests, then days 5-10 become your private honeymoon as guests depart. Resorts like Beaches offer trademarked WeddingMoon packages ($5,000-$15,000 USD) that include everything—planning services, photography, romantic dinners, couples&#x27; spa treatments, and room upgrades that magically happen the morning after your wedding. The best part? You&#x27;re already relaxed, already know the staff (who now treat you like celebrities), and don&#x27;t waste honeymoon days traveling or adjusting to a new place. About 70% of couples choose some version of this, whether formal packages or DIY versions where they simply extend their stay. The only downside: some couples report feeling socially exhausted by day 5 and needing true alone time. Solution: book a private island day trip mid-week to recharge!</p>
                <h3>Do we need to hire a local wedding planner or can we DIY?</h3>
                <p>You technically CAN plan your own Turks and Caicos wedding, just like you technically CAN perform your own root canal—but why would you want to? Local planners ($1,500-$5,000 USD) aren&#x27;t just luxury; they&#x27;re sanity insurance. Here&#x27;s what they actually do: navigate government offices where &quot;island time&quot; means your 2 PM appointment might happen at 4 PM, maintain relationships with vendors who might ghost mainland clients, know which beaches turn into wind tunnels after 3 PM, and most critically, serve as on-island representatives when you&#x27;re planning from thousands of miles away.
The few successful DIY weddings we&#x27;ve seen involved either couples who visited 3-4 times before the wedding (expensive!) or those with extremely simple needs—like elopements with just an officiant and photographer. Even then, most hit snags: the photographer they booked online was actually in Jamaica that week, the &quot;confirmed&quot; caterer had a different definition of &quot;confirmed,&quot; or they discovered their dream beach requires permits they didn&#x27;t know existed. A planner pays for themselves by preventing just one major crisis. They also unlock vendor rates you can&#x27;t access directly and know shortcuts like which taxi driver won&#x27;t overcharge your arriving guests. Consider at least a day-of coordinator ($500-$1,000 USD) as the absolute minimum.</p>
                <h3>What are the best months for a Turks and Caicos wedding?</h3>
                <p>The sweet spot hits between December and April when you get perfect 78-84°F weather, gentle trade winds, and practically zero rain. But here&#x27;s the insider scoop: the &quot;off-season&quot; (May-November) might be your secret weapon for an amazing wedding at 30-40% less cost. Yes, it&#x27;s technically hurricane season, but Turks and Caicos sits pretty far south and sees way less action than other Caribbean islands.
June and July are sneaky-great months—still gorgeous weather but fewer tourists. September and October are the only truly risky months for storms. August can be HOT (85-90°F) but that&#x27;s what the ocean is for! Plus, summer sunsets happen later, giving you better lighting for evening ceremonies. Weather patterns: December-April sees 1-2 inches of rain monthly, May-November gets 2-4 inches but usually in quick afternoon showers that clear fast. Wind picks up November-January (great for water sports, trickier for updos). Water temperature stays 78-83°F year-round—always perfect. Avoid: the week between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s (prices triple), American spring break weeks (March chaos), and September-October unless you&#x27;re comfortable with weather gambles. Best value: first two weeks of May or November.</p>
                <h3>Can we legally get married if we&#x27;re LGBTQ+?</h3>
                <p>This is a crucial question with a complicated answer. As of 2025, same-sex marriage is NOT legally recognized in Turks and Caicos. The islands, as a British Overseas Territory, haven&#x27;t followed the UK&#x27;s marriage equality laws. Local law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and attempts to change this through the courts have so far been unsuccessful.
However, many LGBTQ+ couples still choose Turks and Caicos for commitment ceremonies or celebrations after getting legally married elsewhere. Several resorts and planners enthusiastically welcome and plan beautiful symbolic ceremonies for same-sex couples. You might get legally married in a jurisdiction that recognizes your union, then hold your dream beach celebration in Turks and Caicos. Some couples combine a legal ceremony in Miami or New York with their Caribbean celebration. The islands&#x27; tourism industry is generally welcoming and professional—most vendors care more about love than labels. If this is your path, be upfront with planners about wanting a &quot;commitment ceremony&quot; or &quot;celebration of marriage&quot; rather than a legal ceremony. Many officiants will perform blessing ceremonies that feel exactly like weddings minus the legal paperwork.</p>

Yes, it's a real legal requirement—you must be physically present in the Turks and Caicos Islands for at least 48 hours before you can apply for a marriage license. But here's what they don't tell you in the fine print: this \"waiting period\" transforms into the best pre-wedding party you never knew you needed.\nMost couples (about 85%) extend their stay to 5-7 days anyway, turning bureaucracy into beach time. Think sunset catamaran welcomes ($150-$300 USD per person), beach bonfires on Grace Bay ($500-$1,500 USD), and giving your wedding party time to actually bond over rum punch and conch(konk) fritters. The rule exists because of British colonial law, but it's become such a beloved part of the experience that couples who could legally marry elsewhere still choose the islands specifically for this built-in celebration time. Pro tip: arrive Tuesday or Wednesday since government offices close on weekends!"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What happens if it rains during our beach ceremony?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Great question—and one every couple googles at 2 AM! The reality is that Turks and Caicos enjoys 350 days of sunshine annually, but smart couples always have a Plan B. About 30% of beach receptions end up using their weather backup, though \"rain\" here usually means a 20-minute tropical shower, not an all-day washout.\nMost venues automatically include an indoor backup option in your contract. Resorts like Beaches Turks & Caicos or The Palms(the PALMS) have gorgeous covered pavilions that maintain ocean views while keeping guests dry. Private villa weddings might move to covered terraces or great rooms with those massive sliding doors that blur indoor/outdoor lines. Some couples embrace it—one December wedding had a 10-minute shower during the ceremony, and the photographer captured incredible shots of the couple kissing under a shared umbrella while guests cheered. The bride later said it was her favorite moment because \"everyone was laughing instead of crying, and my hair looked amazing all dewy.\" Weather insurance runs about $300-$500 USD and covers vendor rescheduling costs if needed."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a typical Turks and Caicos wedding actually cost?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The answer spans wider than Grace Bay Beach itself! A typical celebration runs $10,000-$30,000 USD, but let's break that down into real numbers you can work with. Intimate elopements (just the couple plus witnesses) start around $3,000-$5,000 USD including officiant, photographer, and basic beach setup. Small weddings (20-40 guests) average $10,000-$15,000 USD, while larger celebrations (60-150 guests) push into that $20,000-$30,000 USD range.\nYour biggest expenses: venue/reception ($150-$500 USD per guest), photography ($2,000-$6,000 USD), and coordination ($1,500-$5,000 USD). Beach ceremony setups run $500-$2,000 USD depending on complexity. Want to save? Consider May-November's off-season rates (30-40% lower), limit your guest list (every couple you cut saves $300-$1,000 USD), or choose a smaller island like Salt Cay where everything costs less. Splurge zones: private island venues like COMO Parrot Cay(KOH-moh PAIR-ut kay), extended photography with underwater sessions, and premium bar packages. Remember to budget for guest activities—those group catamaran trips and snorkeling excursions add up but create the memories everyone talks about years later."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can Jewish, Hindu, or Muslim couples have religious ceremonies in Turks and Caicos?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Absolutely, though it requires more planning than the Christian ceremonies that dominate the islands' 92% Christian population. Jewish couples regularly bring visiting rabbis from Chabad Lubavitch($1,000-$2,500 USD plus travel expenses) who perform ceremonies under chuppahs decorated with tropical flowers instead of traditional roses. Several couples have created beautiful beach ceremonies incorporating Jewish traditions—one memorable wedding featured a seaside ketubah signing at sunset.\nHindu ceremonies present unique opportunities to blend traditions with tropical settings. While there's no Hindu temple on the islands, visiting priests can perform ceremonies on the beach. The sacred fire ceremony adapts beautifully to beach settings with proper windscreens. One couple created a stunning mandap using bamboo and bougainvillea(boo-gan-VIL-ee-ah) on Grace Bay Beach. Muslim couples often arrange for visiting imams, with the nikah ceremony performed at private villas or resort pavilions. The key for all non-Christian ceremonies: start planning 6-8 months ahead to coordinate visiting clergy, ensure proper ceremony items can be imported (some religious items require customs documentation), and remember that the legal civil ceremony must happen first—religious ceremonies are considered blessings that follow the official marriage."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What's this \"Weddingmoon\" thing and is it worth it?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Weddingmoon is Turks and Caicos' genius solution to the eternal question: \"Why leave paradise for a honeymoon?\" Instead of packing up after your reception and flying somewhere else, you seamlessly transition from wedding to honeymoon without changing resorts. And yes, it's absolutely worth it for most couples!\nHere's how it works: Days 1-4 might be wedding festivities with your guests, then days 5-10 become your private honeymoon as guests depart. Resorts like Beaches offer trademarked WeddingMoon packages ($5,000-$15,000 USD) that include everything—planning services, photography, romantic dinners, couples' spa treatments, and room upgrades that magically happen the morning after your wedding. The best part? You're already relaxed, already know the staff (who now treat you like celebrities), and don't waste honeymoon days traveling or adjusting to a new place. About 70% of couples choose some version of this, whether formal packages or DIY versions where they simply extend their stay. The only downside: some couples report feeling socially exhausted by day 5 and needing true alone time. Solution: book a private island day trip mid-week to recharge!"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do we need to hire a local wedding planner or can we DIY?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "You technically CAN plan your own Turks and Caicos wedding, just like you technically CAN perform your own root canal—but why would you want to? Local planners ($1,500-$5,000 USD) aren't just luxury; they're sanity insurance. Here's what they actually do: navigate government offices where \"island time\" means your 2 PM appointment might happen at 4 PM, maintain relationships with vendors who might ghost mainland clients, know which beaches turn into wind tunnels after 3 PM, and most critically, serve as on-island representatives when you're planning from thousands of miles away.\nThe few successful DIY weddings we've seen involved either couples who visited 3-4 times before the wedding (expensive!) or those with extremely simple needs—like elopements with just an officiant and photographer. Even then, most hit snags: the photographer they booked online was actually in Jamaica that week, the \"confirmed\" caterer had a different definition of \"confirmed,\" or they discovered their dream beach requires permits they didn't know existed. A planner pays for themselves by preventing just one major crisis. They also unlock vendor rates you can't access directly and know shortcuts like which taxi driver won't overcharge your arriving guests. Consider at least a day-of coordinator ($500-$1,000 USD) as the absolute minimum."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are the best months for a Turks and Caicos wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The sweet spot hits between December and April when you get perfect 78-84°F weather, gentle trade winds, and practically zero rain. But here's the insider scoop: the \"off-season\" (May-November) might be your secret weapon for an amazing wedding at 30-40% less cost. Yes, it's technically hurricane season, but Turks and Caicos sits pretty far south and sees way less action than other Caribbean islands.\nJune and July are sneaky-great months—still gorgeous weather but fewer tourists. September and October are the only truly risky months for storms. August can be HOT (85-90°F) but that's what the ocean is for! Plus, summer sunsets happen later, giving you better lighting for evening ceremonies. Weather patterns: December-April sees 1-2 inches of rain monthly, May-November gets 2-4 inches but usually in quick afternoon showers that clear fast. Wind picks up November-January (great for water sports, trickier for updos). Water temperature stays 78-83°F year-round—always perfect. Avoid: the week between Christmas and New Year's (prices triple), American spring break weeks (March chaos), and September-October unless you're comfortable with weather gambles. Best value: first two weeks of May or November."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can we legally get married if we're LGBTQ+?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "This is a crucial question with a complicated answer. As of 2025, same-sex marriage is NOT legally recognized in Turks and Caicos. The islands, as a British Overseas Territory, haven't followed the UK's marriage equality laws. Local law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and attempts to change this through the courts have so far been unsuccessful.\nHowever, many LGBTQ+ couples still choose Turks and Caicos for commitment ceremonies or celebrations after getting legally married elsewhere. Several resorts and planners enthusiastically welcome and plan beautiful symbolic ceremonies for same-sex couples. You might get legally married in a jurisdiction that recognizes your union, then hold your dream beach celebration in Turks and Caicos. Some couples combine a legal ceremony in Miami or New York with their Caribbean celebration. The islands' tourism industry is generally welcoming and professional—most vendors care more about love than labels. If this is your path, be upfront with planners about wanting a \"commitment ceremony\" or \"celebration of marriage\" rather than a legal ceremony. Many officiants will perform blessing ceremonies that feel exactly like weddings minus the legal paperwork."}}]}</script>
