                <p><strong>Cheroid</strong> is a formal marriage proposal ceremony where the groom&rsquo;s family requests permission from the bride&rsquo;s matrilineal clan, typically occurring 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> the wedding and involving 10-50 family elders. This 1-2 hour tradition costs $200-$500 USD, including gifts of food and initial monetary offerings that demonstrate the groom&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s commitment and respect for Palauan matrilineal customs.</p>
                <p>The ceremony begins when the groom&rsquo;s clan visits the bride&rsquo;s family home, presenting traditional gifts such as taro, fish, and sometimes small amounts of <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-udoud-697"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_udoud.mp3" data-definition="traditional bead money" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="udoud - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">udoud</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oo-DOWED</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-udoud-697" class="definition-inline">traditional bead money</span></dfn>. Elders from both sides discuss clan compatibility, ensuring no taboo relationships exist within four generations. The bride&rsquo;s female elders, who hold authority in Palau&rsquo;s matrilineal society, evaluate the proposal based on clan standing and the groom&rsquo;s character.</p>
                <p>Modern adaptations since 2020 include virtual Cheroid ceremonies for diaspora families, with 60% of urban couples in Koror now announcing engagements on social media platforms. Regional variations exist between rural states like Ngiwal, where oral histories dominate discussions, and urban areas where written documentation supplements traditional protocols.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-chad-ra-ua-1385"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_chad_ra_ua.mp3" data-definition="Engagement Gift Exchange" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Chad Ra Ua - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">Chad Ra Ua</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">chad rah OO-ah</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-chad-ra-ua-1385" class="definition-inline">Engagement Gift Exchange</span></dfn></h3>
                <p><strong>Chad Ra Ua</strong> is a pre-wedding engagement ceremony involving formal gift presentations between clans, occurring 3-<time datetime="P6M">6 months before</time> the wedding and lasting 2-4 hours with 50-100 participants. This tradition costs $500-$1,500 USD, with the groom&rsquo;s family presenting udoud (traditional bead money) valued at $300-$1,000 and additional food offerings to solidify the marriage alliance.</p>
                <p>The ceremony centers on wealth exchange, where the groom&rsquo;s clan demonstrates their ability to support the bride through substantial gifts. Traditional presentations include udoud necklaces, woven baskets of food, and sometimes cash contributions. Dancing and traditional Palauan chants follow the formal exchange, with women performing specific movements that honor the matrilineal lineage.</p>
                <p>Post-COVID adaptations have reduced average attendance from 100 to 50-75 guests, while 50% of couples now hire photographers for social media documentation. Carolinian minorities in Palau add Polynesian dance elements, while <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-modekngei-2496"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_modekngei.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Modekngei - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">Modekngei</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moh-dek-NGAY</span></span></span></dfn> adherents (8-10% of population) incorporate indigenous spiritual blessings into the ceremony.</p>

                <p><strong>Chebechiil</strong> is the primary Palauan marriage ceremony that formalizes the union through clan wealth exchanges and vows, lasting 1-2 hours with 100-200 participants on the wedding day.

                <p>The ceremony traditionally occurs in a <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bai-520"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_bai.mp3" data-definition="community meeting house" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bai - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">bai</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">BYE</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-bai-520" class="definition-inline">community meeting house</span></dfn> or church, with 70% of modern couples incorporating civil registration for legal recognition. Chiefs, priests, or judges officiate, beginning with Christian prayers (for the 80% Christian population) before transitioning to traditional elements. The pivotal moment involves the formal exchange of udoud between clan representatives, with specific necklaces worth $500-$2,000 passing from the groom&rsquo;s female relatives to the bride&rsquo;s family.</p>
                <p>Modern Chebechiil ceremonies since 2021 include live-streaming for diaspora family members, with urban couples adding Western elements like ring exchanges. Regional variations see Southwest Islanders incorporating Carolinian chants, while high-clan families emphasize larger udoud presentations. The ceremony concludes with matrilineal blessings from female elders, cementing the bride&rsquo;s continued connection to her birth clan despite marriage.</p>
                <h3>Udoud Exchange (Traditional Wealth Transfer)</h3>
                <p><strong>Udoud Exchange</strong> is a ceremonial transfer of traditional Palauan bead money during Chebechiil, lasting 30-60 minutes and involving 50-100 clan members. This essential tradition costs $500-$2,000 USD, with authentic udoud pieces representing centuries of clan wealth and establishing the economic foundation of the marriage alliance between matrilineal families.</p>
                <p>The exchange follows strict protocols where female representatives from the groom&rsquo;s clan present specific types of udoud to the bride&rsquo;s female elders. High-value pieces like <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-toluk-2091"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_toluk.mp3" data-definition="women&amp;rsquo;s money" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="toluk - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">toluk</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">toh-LOOK</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-toluk-2091" class="definition-inline">women&amp;rsquo;s money</span></dfn> and larger ceremonial necklaces symbolize respect and long-term commitment. Each piece carries historical significance, with some udoud dating back generations and holding specific clan stories.</p>
                <p>Contemporary adaptations include replica udoud for lower-income families, while 30% of urban couples digitally document exchanges for inheritance records. Carolinian communities sometimes substitute shell money, but ethnic Palauans (65.2% of population) maintain traditional bead money preferences. The public nature of the exchange, traditionally followed by clan announcements of specific pieces transferred, reinforces social bonds and obligations.</p>

                <p><strong>Social media integration</strong> has transformed Palauan weddings since 2020, with 70% of urban couples creating pre-wedding photoshoots on pristine beaches. Instagram and Facebook announcements supplement traditional oral invitations, while live-streaming connects diaspora families across time zones. This digital shift particularly affects younger couples in Koror, where internet penetration exceeds 80%.</p>
                <p><strong>COVID-19 adaptations</strong> between 2020-2021 reduced average guest counts from 150 to 50-75, introduced mask requirements, and popularized outdoor venues. Virtual Cheroid ceremonies became acceptable for diaspora families, a practice continuing in 30% of engagements. By 2023, full-scale celebrations resumed, but hybrid elements persist, including streaming for overseas relatives.</p>
                <p><strong>Interfaith and intercultural marriages</strong> reflect Palau&rsquo;s demographic diversity, with 31.6% Asian population influencing ceremonies. Filipino-Palauan weddings incorporate Catholic masses with traditional <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-udoud-2095"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_udoud.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="udoud - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">udoud</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oo-DOWED</span></span></span></dfn> exchanges, while Chinese-Palauan unions add tea ceremonies.

Civil registration occurs simultaneously with religious ceremonies, and professional vendors handle catering and photography.</p>
                <p><strong>Rural state traditions</strong> in Peleliu, Angaur, and Kayangel maintain three-day celebrations with 150-200 participants. Community involvement reduces individual costs to $3,000-$5,000 USD through shared labor and food contributions.

                <p><strong>Southwest Islander variations</strong> among Carolinian communities (1.2% of population) incorporate Polynesian elements including specific dances and coconut-based dishes. These weddings emphasize seafaring traditions, with ceremonies sometimes occurring on beaches with canoe symbolism. Shell money occasionally substitutes for udoud, though integration with Palauan customs remains strong.</p>
                <h3>Religious and Denominational Differences</h3>
                <p><strong>Catholic weddings</strong> (45% of marriages) require pre-marital counseling over 3-6 months, adding $200-$300 to costs. Ceremonies occur in churches with full mass, extending duration to 2 hours. Traditional exchanges follow religious ceremonies, creating distinct morning (religious) and afternoon (traditional) segments. Filipino Catholics particularly emphasize elaborate church decorations.</p>
                <p><strong>Protestant variations</strong> (35% of marriages) include Seventh-day Adventist prohibitions on alcohol and dancing, modifying Mur feast formats. Evangelical communities emphasize testimony sharing during receptions. These weddings average $4,000-$6,000 USD, lower than Catholic ceremonies due to simpler decorations and entertainment restrictions.</p>
                <p><strong>Modekngei traditional religion</strong> (8-10% of population) maintains strongest connections to pre-colonial practices. Ceremonies emphasize ancestral blessings, traditional chants, and specific taboos regarding timing and location. These weddings often occur in sacred groves or traditional bai, with costs varying based on ceremonial requirements ($3,000-$7,000 USD).</p>

                <h3>What is udoud and why is it important in Palauan weddings?</h3>
                <p><strong>Udoud</strong> is traditional Palauan bead money made from ancient glass and ceramic beads, serving as the primary wealth exchange in wedding ceremonies. These beads, valued at $500-$2,000 per ceremonial piece, represent centuries of clan wealth and create binding obligations between families.

                <h3>What are the main differences between urban and rural Palauan weddings?</h3>
                <p>Urban Koror weddings emphasize efficiency with single-day ceremonies, 50-100 guests, and costs of $5,000-$8,000 USD including professional services.

Urban ceremonies occur in hotels or churches with catered meals, while rural events use traditional <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bai-3717"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_bai.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bai - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">bai</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">BYE</span></span></span></dfn> meeting houses with communal cooking. Modern elements like DJs and photographers appear in 70% of urban weddings versus 30% rural.</p>
                <h3>What role do women play in Palauan wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Women hold central authority in Palauan weddings due to matrilineal social structure, with female elders approving marriages and controlling udoud exchanges. Bride&rsquo;s female relatives prepare ngader contributions ($300-$800) demonstrating productive capacity. Women manage food preparation for Mur feasts, particularly <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ongraol-4247"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_ongraol.mp3" data-definition="starch dishes" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="ongraol - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">ongraol</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ong-GRAH-ohl</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-ongraol-4247" class="definition-inline">starch dishes</span></dfn>, and perform specific ceremonial dances. Modern changes see 50% of working women adding cash to traditional contributions. Female chiefs (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bilung-4409"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_bilung.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Bilung - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">Bilung</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bee-LOONG</span></span></span></dfn>) may officiate high-clan ceremonies, and mothers retain property rights affecting Ocheraol planning.</p>
                <h3>How do religious differences affect Palauan wedding ceremonies?</h3>
                <p>Religious affiliation significantly shapes Palauan weddings, with 80% Christian couples incorporating church ceremonies. Catholics (45%) require 3-6 months pre-marital counseling and church masses, adding $200-$300 to costs. Protestant denominations (35%) may prohibit alcohol and dancing, modifying Mur feast entertainment. <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-modekngei-4922"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_modekngei.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Modekngei - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">Modekngei</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moh-dek-NGAY</span></span></span></dfn> followers (8-10%) emphasize ancestral blessings and traditional venues. All religious variations maintain udoud exchanges and clan obligations, creating distinct morning (religious) and afternoon (traditional) ceremony segments. Interfaith marriages blend elements, increasing average costs to $7,000-$10,000.</p>
                <h3>What foods are traditionally served at Palauan weddings?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Palauan wedding foods divide between ongraol (women&rsquo;s starch contributions) and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-odoim-5413"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PAU-PW_odoim.mp3" data-definition="men&amp;rsquo;s protein offerings" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="odoim - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PA"><strong class="term-text">odoim</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oh-DOH-eem</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-odoim-5413" class="definition-inline">men&amp;rsquo;s protein offerings</span></dfn>. Ongraol includes pounded taro, cassava, and sweet potatoes prepared by bride&rsquo;s clan. Odoim features reef fish, pork, sea turtle (now restricted), and fruit bat from groom&rsquo;s family. Modern Mur feasts add rice dishes, Filipino lumpia (31.6% Asian influence), and Western cakes. Catering costs $10-30 per guest, with traditional preparation preferred. Rural weddings maintain communal cooking, while urban celebrations increasingly use commercial catering.</p>
                <h3>When should guests give gifts at Palauan weddings?</h3>
                <p>Gift-giving follows specific protocols throughout Palauan wedding celebrations. During Cheroid, close family brings small offerings ($10-50) supporting initial negotiations. Chad Ra Ua sees larger family contributions ($50-100) supplementing clan exchanges. At Chebechiil ceremonies, guests present money envelopes ($20-100) directly to couple or designated collectors. Mur feast allows additional food contributions or household items. Post-wedding Ocheraol (1-2 years later) involves practical household gifts. Cash increasingly replaces traditional gifts in urban areas, while rural communities maintain food/labor contributions.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
