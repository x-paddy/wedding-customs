This cherished ritual takes place at the family home or beach, where both families gather to witness the couple exchange ei (garlands) made from <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-frangipani-1295"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-CK_frangipani.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="frangipani - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">frangipani</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">fran-jih-PAH-nee</span></span></span></dfn>, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tiare-1307"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_tiare.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tiare - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">tiare</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tee-AH-reh</span></span></span></dfn> flowers, and shells, with costs ranging from NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) for professional floral arrangements.
                The ceremony begins when elders lead traditional blessings in Cook Islands MƒÅori, followed by the couple presenting garlands to each other while wearing <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-pareu-1579"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_pareu.mp3" data-definition="sarongs" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="pareu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">pareu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">pah-REH-oo</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-pareu-1579" class="definition-inline">sarongs</span></dfn> and flower crowns. Participants share coconut water served in traditional shells while family members recount stories of the couple&rsquo;s courtship. In urban Rarotonga, 70% of couples hire professional florists for elaborate ei designs, while outer island celebrations like those in Aitutaki incorporate wild flowers and may include pig presentations as part of the ritual.
                Modern adaptations since 2020 include LED-lit garlands for evening ceremonies and livestreaming for diaspora family members in New Zealand and Australia. The tradition derives from ancient Polynesian welcome customs where garlands signified peaceful intentions between tribes.</p>
                <h3>Traditional Engagement Consultations</h3>
                <p><strong>Family meetings</strong> (known locally as consultations) are formal gatherings where both families discuss wedding arrangements, occurring 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> the ceremony and involving 10-30 immediate family members. These meetings establish financial responsibilities, guest lists, and ceremonial roles, with discussions typically lasting 2-3 hours over a shared meal costing NZD 200-500 (USD 120-300).
                Cook Islands custom dictates that the groom&rsquo;s family presents their intentions formally, often bringing gifts of food or money to demonstrate their commitment. Urban families in Rarotonga increasingly use video calls to include overseas relatives, while rural communities maintain face-to-face gatherings. The bride&rsquo;s family traditionally hosts these meetings, serving local dishes like umu-cooked taro and fresh seafood.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tivaevae-3185"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_tivaevae.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Tivaevae - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">Tivaevae</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tee-VAI-vai</span></span></span></dfn> Quilt Preparation</h3>
                <p><strong>Tivaevae</strong> is a traditional quilting practice where female relatives create elaborate hand-sewn quilts as wedding gifts, requiring 3-6 months of preparation and involving 5-15 women from the bride&rsquo;s family. These intricate quilts feature patterns representing family history and island motifs, with materials and labor valued at NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) per quilt.
                The quilting process brings together generations of women who share stories and marriage advice while stitching. Each tivaevae contains specific patterns: flower designs for fertility, ocean waves for life&rsquo;s journey, and geometric shapes representing family unity. Modern adaptations include machine-sewn sections to reduce preparation time, though 45% of families still insist on completely hand-sewn quilts for their cultural significance.</p>

                <h3>The Christian Marriage Service</h3>
                <p><strong>Christian wedding ceremonies</strong> in the Cook Islands blend Protestant or Catholic liturgy with Polynesian cultural elements, typically lasting 45-60 minutes and accommodating 50-150 guests in churches or beach venues. The service costs NZD 2,000-5,000 (USD 1,200-3,000), including venue rental, minister fees, and traditional decorations of <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-frangipani-397"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-CK_frangipani.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="frangipani - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">frangipani</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">fran-jih-PAH-nee</span></span></span></dfn> arches and shell arrangements.
                The ceremony begins with hymns sung in both English and Cook Islands MƒÅori, with 62.8% of weddings following Protestant traditions through the Cook Islands Christian Church. Couples exchange vows while standing on <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tivaevae-653"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_tivaevae.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tivaevae - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">tivaevae</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tee-VAI-vai</span></span></span></dfn> quilts, symbolizing the foundation of their new life together. The minister incorporates biblical readings with references to Polynesian navigation and ocean metaphors, creating culturally relevant spiritual messages.
                Since 2023, marriage equality laws have enabled same-sex couples to marry, with approximately 20% of ceremonies now including LGBTQ+ couples. Beach ceremonies have increased 60% post-COVID, as couples prefer outdoor venues for health safety and natural beauty.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mong-kol-1149"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_mong_kol.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Mong Kol - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">Mong Kol</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">mohng kohl</span></span></span></dfn> Headdress Blessing</h3>
                <p><strong>Mong Kol</strong> is a ceremonial cotton headdress ritual that physically connects the bride and groom during blessings, lasting 30-60 minutes and involving 10-30 immediate family members at a cost of NZD 300-1,000 (USD 180-600). The single piece of white cotton loops around both partners&rsquo; heads while they kneel to receive prayers and holy water blessings from religious leaders.
                This adapted Buddhist-Polynesian tradition emphasizes the couple&rsquo;s spiritual unity and shared destiny. Family members pour blessed water over the couple&rsquo;s joined hands into a flower-filled tray, with the water later used to nourish a tree planted in their honor. Protestant ceremonies integrate hymn singing during the ritual, while Catholic weddings may include rosary prayers.
                Regional variations show northern atolls emphasizing longer blessing periods with multiple elders participating, while southern islands like Rarotonga streamline the ceremony to 30 minutes. Virtual participation options emerged during 2020-2021, allowing overseas family to offer blessings via video call.</p>
                <h3>Water Pouring Ritual (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-rot-naam-2308"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_rot_naam.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Rot Naam - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">Rot Naam</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">roht NAHM</span></span></span></dfn>)</h3>
                <p><strong>Rot Naam</strong> is a sacred water blessing ceremony where elders pour holy water over the couple&rsquo;s hands using conch shells, typically lasting 1 hour during the wedding reception and involving 50-100 guests. This Polynesian-Christian ritual costs NZD 1,000-3,000 (USD 600-1,800) for ceremonial items, decorations, and the specially prepared blessing station.
                Seated at an ornately decorated table adorned with tropical flowers and shells, the couple receives individual blessings from family elders who pour water while speaking wishes for prosperity, fertility, and happiness. The blessed water, collected in a carved wooden or ceramic tray, carries symbolic meaning - it will later nourish a coconut tree planted to grow alongside the marriage.
                Modern destination weddings feature this ceremony as a photogenic highlight, with 65% incorporating fusion music blending traditional drumming with contemporary island songs. The ritual&rsquo;s origins trace to pre-Christian Polynesian purification ceremonies, now adapted to include Christian prayers and biblical verses about living water.</p>

                <h3>The <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-umukai-8"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_umukai.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Umukai - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">Umukai</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oo-moo-KAI</span></span></span></dfn> Earth Oven Feast</h3>
                <p><strong>Umukai</strong> is a traditional earth oven feast that serves as the wedding reception&rsquo;s centerpiece, lasting 3-5 hours and feeding 50-200 guests at a cost of NZD 5,000-15,000 (USD 3,000-9,000). This communal dining tradition involves cooking whole pigs, taro, breadfruit, and seafood in an underground oven lined with hot stones and banana leaves, requiring 6-8 hours of preparation.
                The feast preparation begins at dawn when male family members dig the umu pit and heat volcanic stones with coconut husks. Food wrapped in banana leaves slow-cooks underground while guests arrive for the ceremony. The dramatic unveiling of the umu becomes a celebration moment, with aromatic steam rising as workers carefully extract the perfectly cooked dishes.
                Urban weddings in Rarotonga often employ professional catering services that maintain traditional cooking methods while meeting modern food safety standards. Rural celebrations in islands like Aitutaki feature extended family members contributing different dishes, with 50% more seafood options compared to urban events. Post-2020 hygiene adaptations include individual serving stations and gloved food handlers.</p>

                <p><strong>Ura</strong> is a traditional narrative dance performed at wedding receptions that tells the couple&rsquo;s love story through hip movements and hand gestures, typically lasting 1-2 hours with 20-100 participants. Professional dance groups charge NZD 1,000-4,000 (USD 600-2,400), while family performances involve weeks of rehearsal and costume preparation.
                Female dancers wearing grass skirts and flower crowns perform synchronized movements while drummers maintain complex rhythms on wooden drums. The choreography incorporates specific gestures representing the couple&rsquo;s meeting, courtship challenges, and ultimate union. Modern performances blend traditional ura with contemporary Pacific fusion moves, attracting younger participants.
                Urban Rarotonga weddings feature the energetic Punanga Nui style in 60% of receptions, while outer island celebrations maintain slower, more ceremonial movements. Guest participation segments encourage everyone to join simplified versions of traditional steps, creating inclusive celebration atmospheres that strengthen community bonds.</p>
                <h3>Traditional Music and Entertainment</h3>
                <p><strong>Wedding entertainment</strong> in the Cook Islands combines traditional drumming, ukulele performances, and hymn singing, lasting throughout the 3-5 hour reception at costs of NZD 1,000-4,000 (USD 600-2,400) for professional musicians. Local bands perform a mixture of Cook Islands MƒÅori songs, contemporary Pacific music, and adapted international hits with island rhythms.
                The musical program typically opens with ceremonial drumming during the couple&rsquo;s entrance, transitions to gentle ukulele serenades during dining, and culminates in energetic dance sets. String bands featuring guitars and ukuleles remain popular for their ability to play both traditional <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-imene-3074"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_imene.mp3" data-definition="hymns" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="imene - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">imene</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ee-MEH-neh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-imene-3074" class="definition-inline">hymns</span></dfn> and modern repertoires.

                <p><strong>Tivaevae presentation</strong> is a post-wedding ritual where female relatives formally gift hand-sewn quilts to the newlyweds, occurring the day after the wedding and involving 10-30 family members. This intimate ceremony, valued at NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) per quilt, represents the transfer of family wisdom and protection to the new household.
                Mothers, aunts, and grandmothers present their quilts while sharing marriage advice and family stories. Each tivaevae pattern carries specific meanings: hibiscus flowers for beauty and attraction, breadfruit leaves for abundance, and ocean waves for life&rsquo;s journeys. The couple displays these quilts in their new home as both functional items and family heirlooms.
                Modern adaptations include machine-assisted sewing for 55% of quilts to accommodate busy lifestyles, though completely hand-sewn versions remain prestigious. Diaspora families increasingly ship quilts from New Zealand or Australia, maintaining cultural connections despite geographic distance.</p>
                <h3>Honeymoon Send-Off Blessing</h3>
                <p><strong>Honeymoon blessings</strong> are farewell ceremonies where families gather to wish the couple well before their departure, lasting 30 minutes and involving 10-20 close relatives at a cost of NZD 200-500 (USD 120-300) for <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ei-1342"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_ei.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="ei - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">ei</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">AY</span></span></span></dfn> garlands and refreshments. This modern adaptation of traditional journey blessings occurs at airports or beaches, depending on the couple&rsquo;s travel plans.
                Family elders place fresh ei around the couple&rsquo;s necks while offering prayers for safe travels and marital happiness. The blessing incorporates traditional navigation metaphors, asking ancestors to guide the couple&rsquo;s journey together. For inter-island honeymoons to destinations like Aitutaki&rsquo;s lagoons, families may accompany couples to the boat or plane.
                Virtual blessings increased 60% during 2020-2024, allowing overseas family members to participate via video calls. Couples honeymooning locally receive modified blessings focusing on discovering new aspects of familiar places together.</p>

            <h2 class="accordion">Regional Variations: Urban Rarotonga vs Outer Island Traditions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Rarotonga Urban Weddings</h3>
                <p><strong>Rarotonga weddings</strong> (distinct from outer island ceremonies) are contemporary celebrations that blend traditional elements with modern conveniences, typically involving 50-100 guests and costing NZD 15,000-30,000 (USD 9,000-18,000). These urban ceremonies occur at beach resorts or church venues in 70% of cases, with professional vendors handling catering, photography, and entertainment.
                Urban couples prioritize efficiency and aesthetics, hiring wedding planners for 40% of ceremonies and choosing sunset beach locations for photography. Traditional elements like the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-umukai-623"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_umukai.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="umukai - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">umukai</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oo-moo-KAI</span></span></span></dfn> feast often come from commercial caterers who maintain authentic cooking methods while meeting health regulations. The Punanga Nui market provides flowers and decorations, supporting local businesses.
                Modern adaptations include cocktail-style receptions replacing sit-down feasts in 30% of urban weddings, and DJ services supplementing traditional bands. Social media integration features prominently, with custom hashtags and professional photographers capturing content for online sharing.</p>
                <h3>Outer Island Traditional Ceremonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Outer island weddings</strong> in locations like Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mangaia maintain stronger traditional practices, involving entire communities of 100-200 people with costs offset by communal contributions. These celebrations emphasize collective participation over individual expense, with families sharing labor and resources rather than hiring vendors.
                Traditional pig presentations remain common in 50% of outer island engagements, where the groom&rsquo;s family delivers live pigs to demonstrate their ability to provide. Community members spend weeks preparing decorations from local materials: palm fronds, shells, and wild flowers. The umukai preparation becomes a communal event with designated roles passed through generations.
                Remote island celebrations extend across multiple days due to travel logistics, with guests arriving by weekly flights or boats. Traditional navigation ceremonies bless inter-atoll journeys, and celebrations incorporate island-specific dances and songs absent from urban weddings.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Religious Integration</h3>
                <p><strong>Christian-Polynesian synthesis</strong> in Cook Islands weddings represents 150+ years of cultural adaptation, with 80% of ceremonies incorporating both biblical teachings and indigenous spiritual concepts. Protestant traditions dominate through the Cook Islands Christian Church (49.1% of population), while Catholic ceremonies (17%) add distinctive liturgical elements.
                The integration appears throughout ceremonies: biblical verses about unity combine with Polynesian navigation metaphors, holy water blessings merge with traditional purification rituals, and Christian hymns sung in Cook Islands MƒÅori preserve linguistic heritage. Ministers trained in both theological and cultural traditions ensure respectful blending of belief systems.
                Sacred locations called <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-marae-810"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MI-CK_marae.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="marae - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MI"><strong class="term-text">marae</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">mah-RAI</span></span></span></dfn>, once sites for pre-Christian ceremonies, now host Christian services that acknowledge ancestral grounds. This synthesis creates unique spiritual experiences unavailable elsewhere, attracting religious tourism alongside destination weddings.</p>
                <h3>Ancestral Connections</h3>
                <p><strong>Genealogical significance</strong> permeates Cook Islands weddings through rituals connecting couples to their ancestral lines and future descendants. Traditional blessings invoke specific ancestors by name, establishing the couple&rsquo;s place within extended family networks spanning multiple islands and generations.

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined ü•π I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! üíç‚ú®

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ‚ù§Ô∏è <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ‚ù§Ô∏è

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Cook Islands wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>A typical Cook Islands wedding costs NZD 10,000-30,000 (USD 6,000-18,000) for local celebrations with 50-150 guests, including venue, catering, traditional elements, and entertainment. Budget options start at NZD 3,000 (USD 1,800) for intimate beach elopements, while elaborate affairs with international guests can reach NZD 50,000 (USD 30,000). Traditional communal weddings in outer islands cost less monetarily but involve significant family labor contributions. The umukai feast alone ranges from NZD 5,000-15,000 (USD 3,000-9,000) depending on guest count and menu complexity. Post-COVID inflation increased costs by approximately 20%, particularly for imported goods and professional services.</p>
                <h3>What is a uipa&#x27;anga in Cook Islands weddings?</h3>
                <p>A uipa&#x27;anga is a traditional family meeting where both families gather to discuss wedding arrangements, responsibilities, and contributions months before the ceremony.</p>
                <h3>How long do Cook Islands wedding celebrations last?</h3>
                <p>Cook Islands wedding celebrations typically last 1-3 days for the core events, though preparations begin months in advance. The main ceremony day includes morning preparations, afternoon vows, and evening feasting lasting 8-10 hours total. Pre-wedding events like the Ei Ceremony occur 1-2 days prior, while post-wedding gatherings extend another 1-2 days. Outer island celebrations often span 3-5 days due to travel logistics and extended family participation. Destination weddings for international couples usually plan 5-7 day packages including the ceremony, cultural activities, and honeymoon experiences. The mandatory 3-day residency requirement before obtaining marriage licenses effectively extends the minimum celebration period.</p>
                <h3>What do Cook Islands brides traditionally wear?</h3>
                <p>Brides typically wear a white dress with tivaevae patterns, a flower crown (ei katu), traditional sandals, and shell jewelry.</p>
                <h3>Who typically attends Cook Islands weddings?</h3>
                <p>Cook Islands weddings involve extensive family networks with 50-150 guests for local ceremonies and 10-50 for intimate destination weddings. Traditional guest lists include extended family across multiple generations, church congregation members, and community leaders. The bride and groom&#x27;s immediate families form the core group of 20-30 people participating in specific rituals like the Ei Ceremony and water blessings. Outer island weddings can attract 200+ attendees representing entire village communities. Modern urban weddings increasingly limit guests for cost management, while diaspora weddings see family traveling from New Zealand, Australia, and other Pacific nations. Professional colleagues and international friends now comprise 20-30% of guest lists in Rarotonga.</p>
                <h3>What is a kainga celebration?</h3>
                <p>Kainga is the traditional wedding reception featuring formal speeches, dance performances, a community feast, gift presentations, and traditional games.</p>
                <h3>What is the ei garland tradition?</h3>
                <p>The ei (pronounced &quot;ay&quot;) garland tradition involves exchanging flower necklaces made from frangipani, tiare, and other tropical blooms, symbolizing love, welcome, and unity between families. During the formal Ei Ceremony 1-2 days before the wedding, both families gather as the couple exchanges specially prepared ei while receiving blessings. The tradition costs NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) for professional arrangements, with urban couples hiring florists while rural families gather wild flowers. Each ei must be fresh, hand-strung, and include specific flowers: white tiare for purity, yellow frangipani for joy, and green leaves for growth. Modern adaptations include LED-lit ei for evening ceremonies and preserved flower options for overseas shipping.</p>
                <h3>How are Cook Islands wedding feasts prepared?</h3>

Preparation begins before dawn, with heated volcanic stones placed in a pit lined with banana leaves. The menu typically includes 5-7 meat dishes, 4-5 starches, tropical fruits, and coconut-based desserts serving 100+ guests. Costs range from NZD 50-150 (USD 30-90) per person depending on protein choices and preparation methods. Modern adaptations accommodate dietary restrictions with 70% of caterers offering vegetarian options using plant-based proteins. Traditional beverages include fresh coconut water and fruit juices, with alcohol varying by religious preferences.</p>
                <h3>What is the akakoro&#x27;anga?</h3>
                <p>Akakoro&#x27;anga is the formal engagement process where the man&#x27;s family requests the woman&#x27;s hand in marriage through a ceremony called pati&#x27;anga.</p>
                <h3>What are the legal requirements for marrying in the Cook Islands?</h3>
                <p>Legal marriage requirements include arriving 3 business days before the ceremony to apply for licenses at the Rarotonga Registrar&#x27;s Office, costing NZD 60-150 (USD 35-90). Couples must provide valid passports, birth certificates, and single status declarations. Divorced individuals need decree absolute documents, while widowed persons require death certificates. The minimum age is 21, or 16-20 with parental consent and court approval. Same-sex marriages became legal in 2023, with approximately 20% of recent ceremonies including LGBTQ+ couples.

Contemporary celebrations feature professional vendors replacing family labor in 60% of urban weddings, resort venues instead of community halls, and fusion menus alongside traditional umukai. Digital elements include livestreaming for diaspora (70% of weddings), drone photography, and social media integration.

Religious elements include hymn singing in Cook Islands MƒÅori, scripture readings adapted with Polynesian metaphors, and pastoral blessings combining Christian theology with cultural values.

                <p>Tivaevae are intricate hand-sewn quilts created by female relatives as wedding gifts, representing one of the Cook Islands&#x27; most significant cultural art forms. These quilts require 3-6 months of collaborative work, with 5-15 women gathering regularly to stitch patterns symbolizing family history, island identity, and marital blessings. Each tivaevae costs NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) in materials and represents countless hours of labor. Traditional patterns include hibiscus flowers for beauty, breadfruit leaves for prosperity, and ocean waves for life journeys. The presentation ceremony occurs post-wedding, with makers sharing marriage wisdom while gifting their work. Modern adaptations include machine-assisted sewing (55% of contemporary quilts) and shipping quilts internationally for diaspora weddings.</p>
                <h3>What religious elements are included in Cook Islands weddings?</h3>

Budget options start at NZD 3,000 (USD 1,800) for intimate beach elopements, while elaborate affairs with international guests can reach NZD 50,000 (USD 30,000). Traditional communal weddings in outer islands cost less monetarily but involve significant family labor contributions. The umukai feast alone ranges from NZD 5,000-15,000 (USD 3,000-9,000) depending on guest count and menu complexity. Post-COVID inflation increased costs by approximately 20%, particularly for imported goods and professional services."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a uipa'anga in Cook Islands weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A uipa'anga is a traditional family meeting where both families gather to discuss wedding arrangements, responsibilities, and contributions months before the ceremony."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do Cook Islands wedding celebrations last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cook Islands wedding celebrations typically last 1-3 days for the core events, though preparations begin months in advance. The main ceremony day includes morning preparations, afternoon vows, and evening feasting lasting 8-10 hours total. Pre-wedding events like the Ei Ceremony occur 1-2 days prior, while post-wedding gatherings extend another 1-2 days. Outer island celebrations often span 3-5 days due to travel logistics and extended family participation. Destination weddings for international couples usually plan 5-7 day packages including the ceremony, cultural activities, and honeymoon experiences. The mandatory 3-day residency requirement before obtaining marriage licenses effectively extends the minimum celebration period."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What do Cook Islands brides traditionally wear?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Brides typically wear a white dress with tivaevae patterns, a flower crown (ei katu), traditional sandals, and shell jewelry."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Who typically attends Cook Islands weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cook Islands weddings involve extensive family networks with 50-150 guests for local ceremonies and 10-50 for intimate destination weddings. Traditional guest lists include extended family across multiple generations, church congregation members, and community leaders. The bride and groom's immediate families form the core group of 20-30 people participating in specific rituals like the Ei Ceremony and water blessings. Outer island weddings can attract 200+ attendees representing entire village communities. Modern urban weddings increasingly limit guests for cost management, while diaspora weddings see family traveling from New Zealand, Australia, and other Pacific nations. Professional colleagues and international friends now comprise 20-30% of guest lists in Rarotonga."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a kainga celebration?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Kainga is the traditional wedding reception featuring formal speeches, dance performances, a community feast, gift presentations, and traditional games."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the ei garland tradition?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The ei (pronounced \"ay\") garland tradition involves exchanging flower necklaces made from frangipani, tiare, and other tropical blooms, symbolizing love, welcome, and unity between families. During the formal Ei Ceremony 1-2 days before the wedding, both families gather as the couple exchanges specially prepared ei while receiving blessings. The tradition costs NZD 500-2,000 (USD 300-1,200) for professional arrangements, with urban couples hiring florists while rural families gather wild flowers. Each ei must be fresh, hand-strung, and include specific flowers: white tiare for purity, yellow frangipani for joy, and green leaves for growth. Modern adaptations include LED-lit ei for evening ceremonies and preserved flower options for overseas shipping."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are Cook Islands wedding feasts prepared?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Wedding feasts are prepared in underground ovens (umu) and include traditional dishes like rukau, fresh seafood, and tropical fruits and vegetables."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What foods are served at a traditional umukai feast?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The umukai feast features whole roasted pigs, taro root, breadfruit, raw fish in coconut cream (ika mata), and various seafood cooked in an underground earth oven. Preparation begins before dawn, with heated volcanic stones placed in a pit lined with banana leaves. The menu typically includes 5-7 meat dishes, 4-5 starches, tropical fruits, and coconut-based desserts serving 100+ guests. Costs range from NZD 50-150 (USD 30-90) per person depending on protein choices and preparation methods.

Couples must provide valid passports, birth certificates, and single status declarations. Divorced individuals need decree absolute documents, while widowed persons require death certificates. The minimum age is 21, or 16-20 with parental consent and court approval. Same-sex marriages became legal in 2023, with approximately 20% of recent ceremonies including LGBTQ+ couples. Celebrants must be registered ministers or civil officials, with ceremonies conducted in English or Cook Islands MƒÅori.

Contemporary celebrations feature professional vendors replacing family labor in 60% of urban weddings, resort venues instead of community halls, and fusion menus alongside traditional umukai. Digital elements include livestreaming for diaspora (70% of weddings), drone photography, and social media integration. Traditional multi-day events compress into single-day celebrations for efficiency. However, essential rituals like the Ei Ceremony, water blessings, and tivaevae presentations remain largely unchanged.

The Cook Islands Christian Church conducts nearly half of all ceremonies, emphasizing biblical teachings about marriage as sacred covenant. Religious elements include hymn singing in Cook Islands MƒÅori, scripture readings adapted with Polynesian metaphors, and pastoral blessings combining Christian theology with cultural values. Churches provide venues, community support, and ceremonial structure. Even secular beach weddings often include prayer elements. Religious differences create ceremonial variations: Protestant services emphasize congregational participation, Catholics add mass elements, while Seventh-day Adventists may exclude dancing and alcohol."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What role does music play in Cook Islands weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Music includes traditional drum performances, dance presentations, wedding songs, and a fusion of modern and traditional musical elements."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can tourists have a traditional Cook Islands wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Tourists can absolutely have traditional Cook Islands weddings, with the destination wedding industry growing 80% since 2020.

Costs for tourist weddings range from NZD 10,000-50,000 (USD 6,000-30,000) including accommodation and activities. Legal requirements remain identical: 3-day residency before license application. Many resorts offer packages incorporating traditional elements while managing logistics. Local communities generally welcome tourist weddings as economic opportunities, with 30% of outer island ceremonies now involving international couples.
