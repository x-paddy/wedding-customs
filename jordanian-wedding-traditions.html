                <p><strong>Jaha</strong> is a formal proposal tradition that initiates the marriage process through a ceremonial visit by male relatives, typically occurring 6-<time datetime="P8M">8 months before</time> the wedding and involving 10-30 men from the groom&rsquo;s family who formally request the bride&rsquo;s hand from her father.</p>
                <h4>Cost and Duration</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional cost</strong>: 500-2,000 JOD ($700-$2,800 USD) for refreshments and gifts</li>
                <li><strong>Duration</strong>: Single evening visit lasting 2-4 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Participants</strong>: 10-30 male relatives from groom&rsquo;s side</li>
                <li><strong>Location</strong>: Bride&rsquo;s family home or reception hall</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Jaha Process</h4>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparation phase</strong>: Groom&rsquo;s family contacts bride&rsquo;s family through intermediaries to arrange visit date</li>
                <li><strong>Arrival ceremony</strong>: Male relatives arrive at bride&rsquo;s home in formal attire carrying traditional sweets</li>
                <li><strong>Coffee ritual</strong>: Host offers Arabic coffee (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-qahwa-1931"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_qahwa.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="qahwa - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">qahwa</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KAH-wah</span></span></span></dfn>) which remains untouched until proposal acceptance</li>
                <li><strong>Formal request</strong>: Elder spokesman delivers prepared speech praising both families</li>
                <li><strong>Acceptance ritual</strong>: Father drinks coffee signifying approval, followed by celebratory refreshments</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Regional Variations</h4>
                <p><strong>Bedouin Jaha</strong> in southern Jordan involves larger delegations (30-50 men) and includes traditional poetry recitation lasting up to 5 hours. The coffee ritual incorporates specific gestures where the cup placement indicates negotiation status.</p>
                <p><strong>Urban Amman approach</strong> differs by including immediate family only (10-15 men) with shortened ceremonies (1-2 hours) often held in hotel meeting rooms rather than homes.</p>
                <h4>Modern Adaptations</h4>
                <p>Contemporary families often combine traditional elements with modern conveniences:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>WhatsApp coordination replacing formal messengers</li>
                <li>Professional photographers documenting the ceremony</li>
                <li>Mixed-gender celebrations following formal male-only ritual</li>
                <li>Reduced delegation sizes (5-10 men) in urban areas</li>
                <li>Virtual attendance options for overseas relatives (added 2020-2024)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cost and Duration</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional cost</strong>: 100-500 JOD ($140-$700 USD) for imam fees and documentation</li>

As of 2024, couples must present identification documents, proof of single status, and medical certificates. The minimum legal age is 18 for both parties, with court exceptions possible from age
                16. ### Mahr: The Islamic Dowry System</p>
                <p><strong>Mahr</strong> is a mandatory Islamic dowry that the groom presents to the bride as financial security, typically ranging from 5,000-50,000 JOD ($7,000-$70,000 USD) and negotiated during the engagement period between both families.</p>

Urban weddings in Amman and other cities typically compress festivities to 2-3 days: henna night, wedding day, and post-wedding <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-waleema-1008"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_waleema.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="waleema - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">waleema</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">wa-LEE-mah</span></span></span></dfn>. Rural and Bedouin communities maintain longer celebrations of 5-7 days with nightly gatherings at different family homes. The main wedding reception itself lasts 5-8 hours, often continuing past midnight with continuous <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dabke-1237"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_dabke.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dabke - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">dabke</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">DAB-keh</span></span></span></dfn> dancing and feasting.</p>
                <h3>What is the purpose of mahr in Jordanian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Mahr is an Islamic religious requirement that provides financial security for the bride, ranging from 5,000-50,000 JOD ($7,000-$70,000 USD) depending on family negotiations. The payment divides into <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-muqaddam-1531"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_muqaddam.mp3" data-definition="immediate" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="muqaddam - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">muqaddam</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">mu-KAD-dam</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-muqaddam-1531" class="definition-inline">immediate</span></dfn> and mu&rsquo;akhkhar (deferred) portions, with 50-70% paid at the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-katb-al-kitab-1618"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_katb_al_kitab.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="katb al-kitab - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">katb al-kitab</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">katb al-ki-TAB</span></span></span></dfn> signing. Beyond religious obligation, mahr demonstrates the groom&rsquo;s financial capability and commitment. Modern couples sometimes reduce mahr amounts to ease financial burden, though families in traditional communities maintain higher expectations. The bride retains full ownership of her mahr as personal property.</p>
                <h3>Who typically attends the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-jaha-1988"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_jaha.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="jaha - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">jaha</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">JAH-hah</span></span></span></dfn> proposal ceremony?</h3>
                <p>The jaha involves 10-30 male relatives from the groom&rsquo;s family visiting the bride&rsquo;s home for formal proposal proceedings. Key attendees include the groom&rsquo;s father, uncles, elder brothers, and respected community members who serve as character witnesses. The bride&rsquo;s side hosts with her father, male relatives, and sometimes community leaders present. Women traditionally remain in separate rooms but listen to proceedings. Modern urban jaha ceremonies may include 5-10 close relatives only, while Bedouin traditions involve larger delegations of 30-50 men. The spokesman (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-khatib-2616"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_khatib.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="khatib - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">khatib</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kha-TEEB</span></span></span></dfn>) leads the formal request.</p>
                <h3>When does the henna night occur in relation to the wedding?</h3>
                <p><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-laylat-al-henna-2726"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_laylat_al_henna.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Laylat al-henna - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Laylat al-henna</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LAY-lat al-HEN-nah</span></span></span></dfn> typically occurs 1-3 nights before the main wedding reception, most commonly on Wednesday evening if the wedding is Friday. This timing allows the intricate henna designs to fully develop their deep color before the wedding day. The celebration lasts 4-6 hours (6 PM to midnight) with 30-100 female guests participating. Some modern brides schedule henna application a week early for darker stains, followed by the party 2 nights before. Rural traditions may extend henna celebrations over 2-3 consecutive nights with different family groups.</p>
                <h3>How do guests dance dabke at Jordanian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Dabke begins when musicians play traditional songs at 120-140 beats per minute, prompting guests to form shoulder-to-shoulder lines. The leader (ra&rsquo;s) stands at the right end, often holding a handkerchief or string of prayer beads, setting the pace with distinctive moves. Dancers link arms or hold hands, moving right-to-left in synchronized steps involving kicks, stomps, and knee bends. Basic dabke follows a six-count pattern accessible to beginners who can join the line&rsquo;s end and follow along. Professional troupes perform complex variations while encouraging guest participation in simpler communal circles throughout the reception.</p>
                <h3>What foods are essential at a Jordanian wedding feast?</h3>
                <p><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mansaf-4073"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_mansaf.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Mansaf - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Mansaf</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MAN-saf</span></span></span></dfn> reigns as the essential centerpiece, featuring lamb cooked in <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-jameed-4142"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_jameed.mp3" data-definition="fermented yogurt" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="jameed - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">jameed</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ja-MEED</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-jameed-4142" class="definition-inline">fermented yogurt</span></dfn> over rice, serving 6-8 people per platter at 10-25 JOD per person. Wedding menus include 5-8 mezze varieties (hummus, mutabal, fattoush, tabbouleh), grilled meat selections, multiple rice preparations, and traditional desserts like <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kanafeh-4400"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_kanafeh.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kanafeh - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">kanafeh</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kna-FEH</span></span></span></dfn> and baklava. Modern receptions add international options while maintaining mansaf prominence. Bedouin weddings might feature whole roasted lamb (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kharoof-mahshi-4553"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_kharoof_mahshi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kharoof mahshi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">kharoof mahshi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kha-ROOF MAH-shi</span></span></span></dfn>), while urban celebrations include elaborate buffets. Arabic coffee and tea service continues throughout, with some venues offering 30-50 dish selections.</p>
                <h3>How much money should guests give as <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nukout-4768"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-JO_nukout.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nukout - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">nukout</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nu-KOOT</span></span></span></dfn>?</h3>
                <p>Nukout amounts vary by relationship proximity and financial capacity, with close family members typically giving 200-500 JOD ($280-$700 USD), extended family contributing 100-200 JOD, friends offering 50-100 JOD, and colleagues providing 20-50 JOD. The reciprocal nature means if someone gave you 100 JOD at your wedding, you should return an equal or slightly higher amount at theirs. Families maintain detailed records to track these social obligations. Wealthy guests may give more, while students or young professionals give smaller amounts without judgment. The envelope should include your name for proper recording.</p>
                <h3>Do Jordanian weddings have gender segregation?</h3>
                <p>Gender segregation levels vary significantly based on family religiosity and regional customs. Traditional Muslim weddings maintain separate celebration spaces, allowing hijabi women to remove headscarves and dance freely among other women. The katb al-kitab and jaha remain male-only events with women listening from adjoining rooms. Modern urban weddings often feature partial segregation with separate dancing areas but mixed dining, or complete integration throughout. Christian Jordanian weddings typically have no segregation. Rural and conservative families maintain stricter separation, while cosmopolitan Amman celebrations increasingly blend arrangements based on guest comfort.</p>
                <h3>How do modern Jordanian couples modify traditional weddings?</h3>
                <p>Contemporary couples adapt traditions by condensing week-long celebrations to 2-3 days, reducing guest lists from 500-1000 to 200-400 people, and choosing hotel venues over home gatherings. Modern modifications include digital invitations supplementing printed cards, photo booths and social media integration, DJ services alongside traditional bands, and buffet service replacing some communal platters. Couples may reduce mahr amounts, combine or eliminate certain pre-wedding parties, include personal vows in ceremonies, and add Western elements like first dances. However, most maintain core traditions like henna night, dabke dancing, mansaf serving, and family involvement in planning.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
