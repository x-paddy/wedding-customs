                <p><strong>Kokooko</strong> is a traditional knocking ceremony that initiates the Ghanaian marriage process, typically occurring 3-<time datetime="P6M">6 months before</time> the wedding and involving 10-20 family members from the groom&rsquo;s side visiting the bride&rsquo;s family home.</p>
                <h4>Cost and Duration</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional cost</strong>: 500-2,000 GHS ($50-$200 USD) for initial gifts</li>
                <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2-4 hours for the ceremony itself</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation time</strong>: 1-3 months of family consultations</li>
                <li><strong>Participants</strong>: 10-20 male family elders and representatives</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Kokooko Process</h4>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Family notification</strong>: Groom informs his father and uncles about his marriage intentions</li>
                <li><strong>Delegation formation</strong>: Senior male relatives organize formal visiting party with designated <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-okyeame-1764"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_okyeame.mp3" data-definition="spokesperson" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="okyeame - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">okyeame</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oh-CHAY-ah-meh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-okyeame-1764" class="definition-inline">spokesperson</span></dfn></li>
                <li><strong>Gift preparation</strong>: Family purchases <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tiri-nsa-1848"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_tiri_nsa.mp3" data-definition="head drinks" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tiri nsa - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">tiri nsa</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">TEE-ree n-SAH</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-tiri-nsa-1848" class="definition-inline">head drinks</span></dfn> including Schnapps and palm wine</li>
                <li><strong>Formal knocking</strong>: Delegation arrives at bride&rsquo;s home and performs symbolic door knocking</li>
                <li><strong>Flowery presentation</strong>: Spokesperson uses proverbs stating &ldquo;we have seen a beautiful flower in your garden&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Initial response</strong>: Bride&rsquo;s family accepts drinks if interested in the proposal</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Regional Variations</h4>
                <p><strong>Akan kokooko</strong> incorporates elaborate linguistic displays with the okyeame demonstrating oratory skills through extended proverbs and metaphors. The ceremony traditionally requires specific drink brands and follows strict protocol regarding seating arrangements.</p>
                <p><strong>Ga-Adangbe approach</strong> differs by including female relatives in later stages and incorporating kola nut presentations. Urban Accra families often condense the ceremony to accommodate busy schedules while maintaining core elements.</p>
                <p><strong>Ewe <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-vofofo-2870"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EE-GH_vofofo.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="vofofo - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EE"><strong class="term-text">vofofo</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">voh-FOH-foh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> represents their version of knocking, where palm wine takes precedence over imported spirits. The groom&rsquo;s family sends decorated pots of <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nsafufuo-3029"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_nsafufuo.mp3" data-definition="palm wine" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nsafufuo - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">nsafufuo</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">n-sah-foo-FOO-oh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-nsafufuo-3029" class="definition-inline">palm wine</span></dfn> carried by young men as part of the proposal ritual.</p>
                <h4>Modern Adaptations</h4>
                <p>Contemporary families often combine traditional protocols with practical adjustments:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>WhatsApp groups coordinate between families reducing multiple physical meetings</li>
                <li>Professional videographers document the ceremony for absent relatives</li>
                <li>Printed programs guide participants through ceremonial steps</li>
                <li>Cash gifts supplement traditional drinks (200-500 GHS typical)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Traditional elements of respect and formal language remain unchanged in modern practice.</p>
                <h3>Family Background Investigations</h3>
                <p><strong>Family investigations</strong> are discrete inquiries both families conduct into each other&rsquo;s backgrounds, typically lasting 2-4 weeks and involving trusted community members gathering information about character, health, and reputation.</p>
                <h4>Investigation Process and Timeline</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Immediate family discusses the proposed match privately</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2-3</strong>: Extended family and community elders consulted</li>
                <li><strong>Week 4</strong>: Final family meeting to discuss findings</li>
                <li><strong>Cost</strong>: No direct cost, but informal gifts to informants (50-200 GHS)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Key Areas of Investigation</h4>
                <p><strong>Character assessment</strong> focuses on the prospective spouse&rsquo;s behavior patterns, work ethic, and social relationships. Families particularly investigate temperament, drinking habits, and treatment of others.</p>
                <p><strong>Health history</strong> examines family medical conditions including mental health, genetic conditions, and fertility indicators. This sensitive investigation happens through discrete community channels.</p>
                <p><strong>Financial stability</strong> evaluates employment status, business ventures, and ability to support a family. Modern investigations might include social media reviews and professional background checks.</p>
                <p><strong>Family reputation</strong> considers the broader family&rsquo;s standing in the community, past scandals, and general respectability. Criminal history and debt problems are major concerns.</p>
                <h4>Modern Investigation Methods</h4>
                <p>Contemporary approaches blend traditional community networks with modern tools:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Google searches and social media profile reviews</li>
                <li>Professional background check services in urban areas  </li>
                <li>Church leader consultations for Christian families</li>
                <li>Formal employment verification for professionals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: Core tradition of thorough family vetting remains unchanged, though methods have modernized.</p>
                <h3>Tiri Nsa: Pre-Wedding Gift Exchanges</h3>
                <p><strong>Tiri nsa</strong> is the ceremonial presentation of head drinks and gifts from the groom&rsquo;s family to the bride&rsquo;s family, typically occurring 1-<time datetime="P3M">3 months before</time> the main ceremony and costing 2,000-10,000 GHS ($200-$1,000 USD) depending on family requirements.</p>
                <h4>Standard Gift Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Alcoholic beverages</strong>: 2-6 bottles of Schnapps (50-150 GHS each)</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional drinks</strong>: Palm wine or <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-akpeteshie-6279"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EE-GH_akpeteshie.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="akpeteshie - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EE"><strong class="term-text">akpeteshie</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ahk-peh-teh-SHEE-eh</span></span></span></dfn> for libation (100-300 GHS)</li>
                <li><strong>Cash component</strong>: 500-5,000 GHS depending on family status</li>
                <li><strong>Fabric</strong>: 6-12 yards of quality cloth (200-1,000 GHS)</li>
                <li><strong>Modern additions</strong>: Smartphones, tablets, or jewelry (500-3,000 GHS)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Regional Gift Variations</h4>
                <p><strong>Northern Ghana requirements</strong> traditionally included cattle (1-4 cows at 2,000-5,000 GHS each), though many families now accept cash equivalents. Shea butter, millet, and traditional smocks also feature.</p>
                <p><strong>Coastal regions</strong> emphasize imported drinks and cash, with Ga families specifically requesting bags of salt (symbolic of preservation) and white cloth for ritual purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>Akan areas</strong> require extensive lists including specific fabric types, gold jewelry, and designated gifts for different family members. The <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-akonta-sekan-7193"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_akonta_sekan.mp3" data-definition="gift for male relatives" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="akonta sekan - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">akonta sekan</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ah-KOHN-tah seh-KAHN</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-akonta-sekan-7193" class="definition-inline">gift for male relatives</span></dfn> applies when the bride has no sisters.</p>
                <h4>Gift Presentation Protocols</h4>
                <p>The formal presentation follows structured patterns with designated family representatives managing each category of gifts. Public display allows both families to witness the fulfillment of requirements, followed by prayers and libation ceremonies.</p>

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Ghana wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>The total cost of a Ghana wedding ranges from 30,000-200,000 GHS ($3,000-$20,000 USD) for middle-class families, including both traditional and white wedding ceremonies. Traditional engagement ceremonies alone cost 10,000-50,000 GHS covering venue, catering for 150-300 guests, bride price of 5,000-20,000 GHS, and entertainment. White weddings add another 20,000-100,000 GHS for church services, formal reception venues, and Western-style elements like wedding cakes and formal photography. Rural weddings in northern regions like Tamale may cost as little as 10,000 GHS total, while elite Accra society weddings can exceed 500,000 GHS. Key factors affecting cost include guest numbers (30-50 GHS per person for catering), venue choice (1,000-30,000 GHS), and family expectations for bride price and gift exchanges.</p>
                <h3>How long does a traditional Ghana wedding ceremony last?</h3>
                <p>A traditional Ghana engagement ceremony typically lasts 4-6 hours from start to finish, though the entire wedding process spans several months. The actual ceremony day begins around 10 AM with family gatherings and negotiations through <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-akyeame-1182"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_akyeame.mp3" data-definition="spokespersons" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="akyeame - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">akyeame</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ah-CHAY-ah-meh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-akyeame-1182" class="definition-inline">spokespersons</span></dfn> taking 1-2 hours.

Modern urban families often condense traditional ceremonies into single-day events, while rural communities may celebrate for 3-7 days with different activities each day.</p>
                <h3>Who pays for what in a Ghana wedding?</h3>
                <p>Financial responsibilities in Ghana weddings follow established cultural patterns with specific obligations for each family. The groom&rsquo;s family covers the bride price (5,000-50,000 GHS), kokooko ceremony expenses, and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tiri-nsa-2090"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_tiri_nsa.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tiri nsa - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">tiri nsa</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">TEE-ree n-SAH</span></span></span></dfn> gifts to the bride&rsquo;s family.

The bride&rsquo;s family traditionally handles the engagement ceremony venue, catering for all guests, decorations, and entertainment including cultural troupes. For white weddings, costs are often shared more equally between families or covered by the couple themselves. Modern couples increasingly contribute their own funds, especially for photography (3,000-10,000 GHS), honeymoons, and Western elements. In northern regions, the groom may provide additional <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-luri-2718"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/DAG-GH_luri.mp3" data-definition="household items" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="luri - click to hear pronunciation" lang="DA"><strong class="term-text">luri</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LOO-ree</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-luri-2718" class="definition-inline">household items</span></dfn> worth 2,000-5,000 GHS. Diaspora families often cover travel costs for overseas relatives attending ceremonies in Ghana.</p>
                <h3>What should I wear to a Ghana traditional wedding as a guest?</h3>
                <p>Wedding guests should wear formal traditional attire with women in kente or African print dresses and men in traditional cloth or formal <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-batakari-3076"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/DAG-GH_batakari.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="batakari - click to hear pronunciation" lang="DA"><strong class="term-text">batakari</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bah-tah-KAH-ree</span></span></span></dfn>. Female guests typically wear elaborate <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kaba-3125"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_kaba.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kaba - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">kaba</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KAH-bah</span></span></span></dfn> and slit styles made from wax print fabrics (200-800 GHS) or machine-print kente (300-1,000 GHS), accessorized with <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-gele-3246"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/YO-GH_gele.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="gele - click to hear pronunciation" lang="YO"><strong class="term-text">gele</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">GEH-leh</span></span></span></dfn> head wraps and beaded jewelry. Male guests wear traditional cloth draped toga-style or sewn <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-agbada-3343"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/YO-GH_agbada.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="agbada - click to hear pronunciation" lang="YO"><strong class="term-text">agbada</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ahg-BAH-dah</span></span></span></dfn> outfits (400-1,500 GHS), though younger men may opt for African print shirts with formal trousers. Colors to avoid include pure white (reserved for the bride) and black (associated with mourning). For northern weddings, guests wear embroidered batakari smocks, while Volta Region events see more <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-agbadza-3646"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EE-GH_agbadza.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="agbadza - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EE"><strong class="term-text">agbadza</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ahg-BAHD-zah</span></span></span></dfn>-inspired outfits. Diaspora guests can purchase outfits from local markets like Makola or Kantamanto for 150-500 GHS. Comfortable shoes are essential as celebrations involve extended standing and dancing during adowa performances and reception activities.</p>
                <h3>How do Ghana wedding negotiations work?</h3>
                <p>Ghana wedding negotiations follow formal protocols where appointed family spokespersons (akyeame) conduct discussions using proverbs and indirect language, typically lasting 1-2 hours during the engagement ceremony. The groom&rsquo;s akyeame presents the family&rsquo;s request using flowery language like &ldquo;we have seen a beautiful flower in your garden,&rdquo; never mentioning the bride directly initially. The bride&rsquo;s family spokesperson responds with similar indirect language, sometimes claiming ignorance of any &ldquo;flower&rdquo; to maintain formal protocol. After establishing rapport, negotiations cover the bride list requirements including specific drinks (Schnapps, imported wines), cash amounts (5,000-50,000 GHS), and traditional items. The bride is called three times to publicly consent, whispering her acceptance to an elder who announces it formally. Modern families may provide printed lists beforehand to avoid surprises, though public negotiations remain ceremonially important. Professional akyeame charge 500-2,000 GHS for their linguistic expertise in managing these delicate discussions.</p>
                <h3>When is the best time to have a Ghana wedding?</h3>
                <p>The ideal time for Ghana weddings is during the dry season from November to March when weather is predictable and venues are accessible, with December being peak wedding season despite higher costs. December weddings benefit from diaspora family availability during Christmas holidays but face premium pricing with venues charging 20-50% more and vendors fully booked months in advance. January-March offers better vendor availability and pricing while maintaining good weather. The rainy season (April-October) sees fewer weddings due to transportation challenges and outdoor venue limitations, though indoor Accra venues offer 20-30% discounts. Traditional farmers avoid planting season (April-May) and harvest time (August-September) when rural communities are occupied. Muslim families consider Ramadan restrictions, while Christians often prefer Saturdays for convenience. Cultural calendars matter too - Ashanti weddings avoid certain sacred days, while Ga families plan around Homowo festival. Budget-conscious couples find September-November offers optimal balance of reasonable weather and lower pricing.</p>
                <h3>What happens during the kokooko (knocking) ceremony?</h3>
                <p>The kokooko ceremony initiates Ghana&rsquo;s marriage process when the groom&rsquo;s family formally &ldquo;knocks&rdquo; on the bride&rsquo;s family door to declare marriage intentions, typically lasting 2-4 hours on a Saturday morning. The groom&rsquo;s delegation of 10-20 male elders arrives bearing tiri nsa (head drinks) including 2-6 bottles of Schnapps (50-150 GHS each), cash gifts (500-2,000 GHS), and sometimes kola nuts. The appointed <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-okyeame-6785"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TW-GH_okyeame.mp3" data-definition="spokesperson" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="okyeame - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TW"><strong class="term-text">okyeame</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oh-CHAY-ah-meh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-okyeame-6785" class="definition-inline">spokesperson</span></dfn> uses elaborate proverbs to state their mission, never mentioning names directly but saying phrases like &ldquo;our son has seen something beautiful in your house.&rdquo; The bride&rsquo;s family spokesperson responds formally, accepting the drinks &ldquo;for our elders&rdquo; while promising to investigate the matter. If drinks are rejected, negotiations end immediately. After acceptance, families may discuss preliminary expectations though detailed bride price negotiations happen later. The bride herself doesn&rsquo;t appear but is consulted privately. Modern families often combine kokooko with initial background investigations, reducing multiple visits for busy urban dwellers.</p>
                <h3>How are modern Ghana weddings different from traditional ones?</h3>
                <p>Modern Ghana weddings blend traditional elements with contemporary additions, creating hybrid celebrations that honor culture while embracing global trends and technology. Today&rsquo;s ceremonies feature professional wedding planners (2,000-50,000 GHS), social media documentation with custom hashtags, and live streaming for diaspora relatives unable to attend. Traditional negotiations through akyeame continue but with printed bride lists and mobile money transfers supplementing cash presentations. Venues have shifted from family compounds to hotels and event centers with elaborate decorations, LED screens, and climate control. White weddings now accompany traditional ceremonies for 70% of urban couples, doubling overall costs. Modern brides wear multiple outfits - traditional kente, Western white gowns, and reception dresses - while maintaining symbolic elements like dansinkran beads. Entertainment combines cultural troupes performing adowa with professional DJs playing afrobeats. However, core traditions persist: family involvement remains paramount, kokooko ceremonies still initiate the process, and elders&rsquo; blessings are considered essential for marital success regardless of contemporary additions.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of kente in Ghana weddings?</h3>
                <p>Kente represents the ultimate symbol of prestige and cultural identity in Ghana weddings, with authentic handwoven pieces costing 500-5,000 GHS per outfit and taking master weavers 3-6 months to complete. Each kente pattern carries specific meanings - &ldquo;Sika wo ntaban&rdquo; (money has wings) warns about financial responsibility, while &ldquo;Wofro dua pa a&rdquo; (when you climb a good tree) symbolizes making wise life choices. Wedding kente incorporates symbolic colors: gold threads represent wealth and spiritual purity, red signifies spiritual presence, green symbolizes growth and fertility, while blue represents love and harmony. Ashanti kente from Bonwire differs from Ewe kente in weaving techniques, with couples often choosing patterns reflecting their ethnic heritage. Modern couples commission exclusive designs incorporating their initials or wedding dates, creating family heirlooms. Beyond clothing, kente appears in wedding decorations, invitation cards, and even wedding cakes. The presentation of kente to the bride during traditional ceremonies symbolizes her acceptance into the groom&rsquo;s family and their commitment to clothing and caring for her.</p>
                <h3>How do families investigate each other before Ghana marriages?</h3>
                <p>Family investigations before Ghana marriages involve discrete inquiries lasting 2-4 weeks where both families research each other&rsquo;s backgrounds through community networks and modern methods. Traditional investigations employ trusted family friends, church members, or work colleagues who discretely gather information about character, family reputation, health history, and financial stability without directly approaching the subjects. Key areas examined include behavioral patterns (temperament, drinking habits, previous relationships), family health concerns (mental illness, genetic conditions, fertility), financial responsibility (steady employment, debt issues), and criminal history. Modern investigations incorporate Google searches, social media profile reviews, and professional background checks costing 500-2,000 GHS in urban areas. Religious families consult pastors or imams for character references. Some families hire private investigators for high-profile matches. If investigations reveal concerns like undisclosed children, substance abuse, or family scandals, marriages are quietly called off. The process protects both families from unsuitable unions while maintaining privacy and dignity throughout the verification period.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
