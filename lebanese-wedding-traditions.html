                <p><strong>Tulbe</strong> is a formal marriage proposal tradition that initiates the wedding process through family negotiations, typically occurring 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> the wedding and involving 10-20 family members from both sides.</p>
                <h4>Cost and Duration</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional cost</strong>: $2,000-$5,000 USD (gifts and hospitality)</li>

                <h4>Regional Variations</h4>
                <p><strong>Christian Lebanese Tulbe</strong> incorporates blessing from family priest and exchange of religious icons, with celebrations beginning immediately upon acceptance.</p>
                <p><strong>Muslim Lebanese approach</strong> differs by including <strong>Sheikh</strong> presence for religious guidance and formal <strong>katb ktab</strong> discussion during the proposal visit.</p>
                <p><strong>Druze tradition</strong> (distinct from other Lebanese customs) requires clan elder approval and incorporates unique <strong>uqqal</strong> blessing ceremony.</p>

                <h3>How much does a typical Lebanese wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>The total cost of a Lebanese wedding ranges from $30,000-$100,000 USD, with urban Beirut celebrations averaging $75,000 and rural weddings around $25,000. Major expenses include venue rental ($5,000-$20,000), catering at $50-$150 per guest for 200-500 attendees, <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-zaffe-330"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_zaffe.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="zaffe - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">zaffe</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ZAFF-eh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances ($2,000-$5,000), and the bride&rsquo;s <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dahab-405"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_dahab.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dahab - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">dahab</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">thah-HAB</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (gold jewelry) gifts ($5,000-$20,000). Additional costs include photography ($3,000-$8,000), flowers ($2,000-$10,000), and musician fees ($2,000-$5,000). Many families save for years or take loans, as weddings represent major social investments in Lebanese culture.</p>
                <h3>What is the traditional order of events at a Lebanese wedding?</h3>
                <p>A traditional Lebanese wedding follows a structured timeline beginning with the <strong>zaffe</strong> procession (30-45 minutes) leading into the venue, followed by the religious ceremony (45-90 minutes) if not completed earlier. The reception starts with cocktails and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mezza-1044"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_mezza.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mezza - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">mezza</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MEZ-zah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> service (2 hours), then transitions to dinner service with the couple&rsquo;s grand entrance (1 hour). <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dabke-1170"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_dabke.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Dabke - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Dabke</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">DAB-keh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> dancing begins during dinner and continues throughout the night (4-6 hours), interspersed with <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-saif-1288"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_saif.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="saif - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">saif</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SAYF</span></span></span></dfn></strong> cake cutting ceremony (midnight typically), <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-zaghrouta-1354"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_zaghrouta.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="zaghrouta - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">zaghrouta</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">zagh-ROO-tah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances at key moments, and continuous dancing until dawn (5-6 AM). The celebration maintains high energy throughout, with no traditional &ldquo;send-off&rdquo; as couples stay until the last guest departs.</p>
                <h3>Who traditionally pays for a Lebanese wedding?</h3>
                <p>Lebanese wedding expenses follow complex traditional patterns where both families contribute significantly. The groom&rsquo;s family typically covers the <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mahr-1810"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_mahr.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mahr - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">mahr</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MAH-her</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (dower) of $5,000-$50,000, <strong>dahab</strong> jewelry for the bride ($5,000-$20,000), the <strong>zaffe</strong> procession, and often the honeymoon. The bride&rsquo;s family traditionally funds the reception venue, catering, flowers, and decorations - often the largest expenses. Modern couples increasingly contribute 30-50% of costs themselves, especially diaspora Lebanese. The <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-jihaz-2218"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_jihaz.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="jihaz - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">jihaz</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">jih-HAZ</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (household furnishing) remains the bride&rsquo;s family responsibility, while musical entertainment and photography are often split. Extended family members may gift money during the <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nuqout-2424"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_nuqout.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nuqout - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">nuqout</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">noo-KOOT</span></span></span></dfn></strong> tradition to help offset costs.</p>
                <h3>What should guests wear to a Lebanese wedding?</h3>
                <p>Lebanese wedding attire requires formal, glamorous dress exceeding typical Western wedding standards. Women wear floor-length evening gowns with elaborate beading, sequins, or embroidery - think &ldquo;red carpet&rdquo; rather than cocktail dress. Designer gowns or high-end boutique dresses are standard, with many guests spending $500-$2,000 on attire. Men wear dark formal suits or tuxedos, with traditional <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sherwal-2954"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_sherwal.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sherwal - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">sherwal</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sher-WAL</span></span></span></dfn></strong> acceptable for older relatives. Modesty requirements vary by religious venue - churches and mosques require covered shoulders and knees, while reception venues allow more revealing attire. Guests avoid white (bride&rsquo;s color) and sometimes red (depending on region). Jewelry should be substantial, as underdressing is considered disrespectful to the celebrating families.</p>
                <h3>How long do Lebanese wedding celebrations last?</h3>
                <p>Lebanese weddings are marathon celebrations typically lasting 8-12 hours for the main event, with festivities beginning around 7-8 PM and continuing until 5-6 AM. The extended timeframe includes multiple phases: arrival and <strong>zaffe</strong> (1 hour), ceremony if applicable (1-1.5 hours), extended cocktail and <strong>mezza</strong> period (2 hours), dinner service (2 hours), and dancing until dawn (4-6 hours). Some traditional weddings span multiple days with <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-laylieh-3889"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_laylieh.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="laylieh - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">laylieh</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LAY-lee-yeh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> pre-parties and post-wedding gatherings. The bride and groom must remain until every guest departs - leaving early violates hospitality customs. Guests pace themselves for the long celebration, with coffee service around 2 AM providing second wind for continued <strong>dabke</strong> dancing.</p>
                <h3>What are the must-have Lebanese wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Essential Lebanese wedding traditions that appear in virtually every celebration include the <strong>zaffe</strong> entrance procession (considered mandatory - &ldquo;a wedding without zaffe is not complete&rdquo;), <strong>dabke</strong> line dancing throughout the reception, elaborate <strong>mezza</strong> and feast service, and <strong>zaghrouta</strong> <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ululation-4629"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/EN-LB_ululation.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="ululation - click to hear pronunciation" lang="EN"><strong class="term-text">ululation</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">yoo-loo-LAY-shun</span></span></span></dfn> at key moments. The <strong>saif</strong> sword cake-cutting adds dramatic flair while honoring heritage. Modern couples may abbreviate other elements but rarely omit these core five traditions. Additional important customs include the formal <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tulbe-4890"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_tulbe.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tulbe - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">tulbe</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">TOOL-beh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> proposal process, <strong>dahab</strong> gold jewelry gifts, and staying until the last guest leaves. Professional <strong>zaffe</strong> groups are booked months in advance, as this tradition particularly defines a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Lebanese wedding in community eyes.</p>
                <h3>How do Muslim and Christian Lebanese weddings differ?</h3>
                <p>While Lebanese weddings share cultural traditions like <strong>zaffe</strong> and <strong>dabke</strong>, religious differences create distinct ceremony variations. Muslim weddings feature <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-katb-al-kitab-5445"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_katb_al_kitab.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="katb al-kitab - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">katb al-kitab</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KATB al-ki-TAB</span></span></span></dfn></strong> contract signing with a <strong>Sheikh</strong>, often in a religious court or mosque meeting room, lasting 30-45 minutes with gender-separated seating. Christian ceremonies occur in churches with mass lasting 60-90 minutes, including communion and crown ceremonies. Muslim celebrations may have brief periods of gender separation during religious components, while Christian receptions remain mixed throughout. Alcohol service varies - common at Christian weddings, absent or limited at conservative Muslim celebrations. Both feature elaborate feasts, but Muslim weddings ensure <strong>halal</strong> preparation. Dancing, music, and cultural traditions remain remarkably similar across religious lines.</p>
                <h3>What is a Zaffe and why is it important?</h3>
                <p><strong>Zaffe</strong> is a musical procession featuring professional drummers, dancers, and sometimes sword performers who announce and celebrate the couple&rsquo;s arrival, lasting 30-45 minutes and costing $2,000-$5,000. Dating from 14th-century military parades, <strong>zaffe</strong> evolved into Lebanon&rsquo;s most distinctive wedding tradition - experts note &ldquo;if the wedding lacks a Zaffe, which is never the case, a wedding is still not considered complete.&rdquo; Professional groups perform synchronized <strong>dabke</strong> steps while playing <strong>tabl baladi</strong> drums and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mizmar-6844"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_mizmar.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mizmar - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">mizmar</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">miz-MAR</span></span></span></dfn></strong> wind instruments. The procession creates immediate festive atmosphere, involves guest participation, and provides dramatic photo opportunities. Modern <strong>zaffe</strong> groups offer packages from basic drummers to elaborate productions with pyrotechnics, maintaining this essential tradition across all Lebanese communities worldwide.</p>
                <h3>What are typical Lebanese wedding favors?</h3>
                <p>Lebanese wedding favors, called <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-makhbaz-7298"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_makhbaz.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="makhbaz - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">makhbaz</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">makh-BAZ</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, traditionally include sugared almonds (<strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mulabbas-7363"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_mulabbas.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mulabbas - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">mulabbas</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moo-LAB-bas</span></span></span></dfn></strong>) in odd numbers (5, 7, or 9) symbolizing indivisibility of the couple.

Modern additions include miniature <strong>maamoul</strong> cookies, custom <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-attar-7689"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_attar.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="attar - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">attar</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ah-TAR</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (perfume) bottles, or prayer beads for religious families. Upscale weddings feature luxury favors like engraved silver pieces or designer items ($30-$100 each). Some couples donate to charity in guests&rsquo; names, particularly popular among diaspora Lebanese. Traditional <strong>tulle</strong> wrapping remains common, with colors matching wedding theme. Distribution occurs during the reception or placed at table settings, with special elaborate versions for close family members.</p>
                <h3>How do Lebanese engagement traditions work?</h3>
                <p>Lebanese engagements begin with <strong>tulbe</strong> (formal proposal) then proceed to <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-khotbeh-8347"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-LB_khotbeh.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="khotbeh - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">khotbeh</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KHOT-beh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (official engagement), typically lasting 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> wedding. The <strong>tulbe</strong> involves the groom&rsquo;s family visiting with elders to formally request marriage, bringing traditional sweets and discussing <strong>mahr</strong> (dower).

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
