                <p><strong>Fiyansay</strong> is a formal engagement ceremony that marks the official agreement between two families to unite through marriage, typically occurring 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> the wedding and involving 20-50 close family members. This intimate gathering traditionally takes place at the bride&rsquo;s family home, where the groom&rsquo;s family presents gifts including jewelry worth 5,000-15,000 SCR ($370-$1,100 USD), imported wine, and symbolic items like coconuts representing fertility. The ceremony lasts 2-3 hours and includes the exchange of rings, blessing prayers in Creole, and a small feast featuring traditional dishes like <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kari-poul-720"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kari_poul.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kari poul - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kari poul</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-ree pool</span></span></span></dfn></strong> and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bouyon-blan-751"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_bouyon_blan.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bouyon blan - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">bouyon blan</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">boo-yohn blahn</span></span></span></dfn></strong>.</p>
                <p>Modern Seychellois couples increasingly host <strong>fiyansay</strong> ceremonies at beachside restaurants or hotels, spending 10,000-25,000 SCR ($740-$1,850 USD) for a more elaborate celebration. These contemporary engagements often include professional photography, live <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sega-1061"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_sega.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sega - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">sega</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SEH-gah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> music performances, and fusion menus combining Creole cuisine with international dishes. Despite modernization, the core tradition of family blessing and formal announcement remains unchanged, with elders from both families offering advice and biblical readings.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bann-1346"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_bann.mp3" data-definition="Church Announcements" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Bann - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">Bann</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bahn</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-bann-1346" class="definition-inline">Church Announcements</span></dfn></h3>
                <p><strong>Bann</strong> is a <a href="catholic-wedding-traditions.html">Catholic tradition</a> of public marriage announcements read during Sunday mass on three consecutive weeks, typically beginning one month before the wedding and reaching 200-500 parishioners across the island community. This practice, derived from French colonial law, requires couples to register their intention to marry at their local parish, providing birth certificates, baptism records, and proof of single status. The priest announces the couple&rsquo;s names, parents&rsquo; names, and wedding date, inviting any objections to be raised within the three-week period.</p>
                <p>The <strong>bann</strong> system serves both religious and legal purposes in Seychelles, where approximately 76% of marriages occur in Catholic churches. Each announcement costs 500-1,000 SCR ($37-$74 USD) in church fees, though some parishes waive charges for regular members. Modern adaptations include digital announcements on church websites and WhatsApp groups, ensuring wider reach across Seychelles&rsquo; 115 islands. The tradition connects to the subsequent <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-publikasyon-sivil-2509"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_publikasyon_sivil.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="publikasyon sivil - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">publikasyon sivil</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">poo-blee-kah-SYOHN see-VEEL</span></span></span></dfn></strong> at the civil status office, creating a dual-track marriage validation process.</p>

                <p>Contemporary <strong>entereman</strong> parties have evolved into elaborate weekend events costing 5,000-20,000 SCR ($370-$1,480 USD) per person, including catamaran cruises, resort stays, and organized activities like snorkeling at Sainte Anne Marine Park. Despite modernization, certain taboos persist: mixing genders remains uncommon, excessive drinking that could shame families is discouraged, and the bride traditionally wears white clothing gifted by her godmother. These celebrations strengthen social bonds within the tight-knit island communities, where wedding guests often know each other from childhood.</p>

                <p><strong>Seremoni sivil</strong> is the legal marriage ceremony conducted by a civil status officer, required for all marriages in Seychelles regardless of religious ceremonies, typically lasting 20-30 minutes with 10-20 witnesses. Couples must book appointments at the Civil Status Office in Victoria or district offices, paying 500 SCR ($37 USD) for the ceremony plus 100 SCR ($7.40 USD) per marriage certificate copy. The ceremony occurs in government buildings during weekday office hours, though special arrangements for beach or hotel venues cost an additional 5,000-10,000 SCR ($370-$740 USD).</p>
                <p>Modern couples increasingly choose civil ceremonies as their primary celebration, particularly for destination weddings where foreign guests cannot attend church services requiring membership documentation. Popular venues include Anse Source d&rsquo;Argent beach on La Digue, costing 15,000-25,000 SCR ($1,110-$1,850 USD) for permits and setup, or heritage sites like Domaine de Val des Prés. The civil ceremony follows the Marriage Act requirements: declaration of no impediments, exchange of vows in English or Creole, signing of registers by couple and witnesses, and official pronouncement of marriage.</p>

                <h3>Moutya (<a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-traditions-around-the-world">Traditional Wedding</a> Dance)</h3>
                <p><strong>Moutya</strong> is an African-derived dance tradition performed at Seychellois weddings as a blessing for fertility and marital harmony, typically involving 20-40 dancers in a circle formation and lasting 30-60 minutes. This UNESCO-recognized cultural heritage features call-and-response singing, rhythmic drumming on heated <strong>ravann</strong> drums, and provocative hip movements that symbolize sensuality and procreation. Wedding <strong>moutya</strong> differs from casual performances by including specific songs mentioning the couple&rsquo;s names and family histories, composed by community elders charging 2,000-5,000 SCR ($148-$370 USD) for their services.</p>
                <p>The dance traditionally occurs after midnight when &ldquo;spirits are most receptive,&rdquo; performed barefoot on sand or earth to maintain connection with ancestors. Women wear <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kazak-3992"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kazak.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kazak - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kazak</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-ZAHK</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (loose blouses) and long skirts allowing freedom of movement, while men dress in simple cotton pants and shirts. Modern weddings sometimes hire professional <strong>moutya</strong> troupes for 10,000-20,000 SCR ($740-$1,480 USD), though authenticity concerns arise when performers lack family connections to the couple.

Elders often gift symbolic items during blessing: <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-gren-benyem-2415"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_gren_benyem.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="gren benyem - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">gren benyem</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">grehn ben-YEM</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (blessed seeds) for fertility, antique <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kas-2483"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kas.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kas - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kas</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kahs</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (money boxes) for prosperity, or family <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-zanno-2544"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_zanno.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="zanno - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">zanno</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">zah-NOH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (heirloom jewelry) worth 5,000-50,000 SCR ($370-$3,700 USD). Modern adaptations include video recording these blessings for overseas family members, though some elders resist documentation believing it diminishes spiritual potency.

                <p><strong>Lenmenyen</strong> is the day-after wedding breakfast gathering that reunites close family and friends to share leftover food, exchange stories, and help with cleanup, typically involving 30-50 people from 9 AM to noon. This informal tradition serves practical purposes: consuming perishable foods before tropical heat causes spoilage, returning borrowed items like chairs and <strong>tanto</strong> (tents), and allowing intimate conversation impossible during large receptions. The menu features reheated <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kari-3518"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kari.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kari - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kari</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-REE</span></span></span></dfn></strong> dishes, fresh <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dipain-3554"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_dipain.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dipain - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">dipain</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">dee-PEN</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (bread) from local bakeries, strong black coffee, and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dite-sitronnel-3632"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_dite_sitronnel.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dite sitronnel - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">dite sitronnel</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">dee-tay see-troh-NEL</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lemongrass tea) believed to cure hangovers.</p>

                <h3>Mahé Wedding Traditions</h3>
                <p><strong>Mahé wedding traditions</strong> reflect the capital island&rsquo;s cosmopolitan nature while maintaining distinct Creole customs, accommodating 85% of Seychelles&rsquo; population and offering the most venue diversity. Victoria-based weddings average 150,000-300,000 SCR ($11,100-$22,200 USD) total cost, significantly higher than outer island celebrations due to hotel venue preferences and professional service availability. Popular locations include Hilton Seychelles Northolme Resort charging 2,000-3,500 SCR ($148-$259 USD) per guest, or Eden Island venues accommodating yacht-arriving guests. Mahé weddings uniquely incorporate <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kazino-687"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kazino.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kazino - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kazino</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-zee-NOH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (casino) after-parties at Berjaya Beau Vallon Bay Resort, where wedding groups receive special packages including gaming chips worth 5,000 SCR ($370 USD) per couple.</p>
                <p>The island&rsquo;s cultural diversity appears in fusion <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-lasosiye-940"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_lasosiye.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="lasosiye - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">lasosiye</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">lah-soh-SEE-yay</span></span></span></dfn></strong> menus combining Creole, <a href="indian-wedding-traditions.html">Indian</a>, <a href="chinese-wedding-traditions.html">Chinese</a>, and European cuisines, reflecting Mahé&rsquo;s role as the melting pot since 1770s settlement. <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-moutya-1193"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_moutya.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Moutya - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">Moutya</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moo-TYAH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances on Mahé often feature the renowned Beau Vallon Cultural Troupe, whose wedding bookings cost 25,000-40,000 SCR ($1,850-$2,960 USD) due to their international recognition. Urban couples increasingly choose shortened celebrations fitting weekend schedules, unlike outer islands where week-long festivities remain common. However, Mahé maintains unique traditions like <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-benir-loto-1595"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_benir_loto.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="benir loto - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">benir loto</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">beh-NEER loh-toh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (car blessing) where priests bless decorated wedding vehicles at Anse Aux Pins church, costing 500-1,000 SCR ($37-$74 USD) donation.</p>
                <h3>Praslin and La Digue Customs</h3>
                <p><strong>Praslin and La Digue wedding customs</strong> preserve more traditional elements due to smaller populations and stronger community bonds, with celebrations typically costing 80,000-150,000 SCR ($5,920-$11,100 USD) total. These sister islands share the tradition of <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-lanmens-dimans-2074"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_lanmens_dimans.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="lanmens dimans - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">lanmens dimans</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">lahn-mens dee-MAHNS</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (Sunday procession) where the wedding party walks from church to reception venue accompanied by the entire village, creating spectacular photo opportunities along beaches like Anse Lazio or Anse Source d&rsquo;Argent. Transportation between islands for guests requires careful coordination, with ferry tickets costing 1,000-1,500 SCR ($74-$111 USD) per person or charter boats at 15,000-25,000 SCR ($1,110-$1,850 USD) for groups.</p>
                <p>La Digue&rsquo;s ox-cart wedding transportation remains popular despite modernization, charging 2,000-3,000 SCR ($148-$222 USD) per cart for the journey from La Passe jetty to venues. Praslin&rsquo;s <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kok-de-mer-2743"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kok_de_mer.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kok-de-mer - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kok-de-mer</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kohk-deh-MEHR</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (coco de mer) incorporation makes weddings unique: couples exchange miniature replicas costing 5,000-15,000 SCR ($370-$1,110 USD) as fertility symbols, though actual nuts require CITES permits. Both islands feature <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-veye-2986"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_veye.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="veye - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">veye</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-YAY</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (wake-style pre-wedding gatherings) where communities spend entire nights singing, sharing <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tizann-3099"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_tizann.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tizann - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">tizann</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tee-ZAHN</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (herbal teas), and preparing traditional foods. The islands&rsquo; limited venues mean most receptions occur at community centers or beaches, with the District Administration providing chairs and tents for nominal fees of 2,000-5,000 SCR ($148-$370 USD).</p>
                <h3>Outer Island Adaptations</h3>
                <p><strong>Outer island wedding adaptations</strong> accommodate logistical challenges of celebrations on remote islands like Silhouette, Bird, or Denis Island, where guest transportation alone can cost 50,000-150,000 SCR ($3,700-$11,100 USD). These exclusive celebrations typically involve 30-80 guests maximum due to accommodation limitations, with total wedding packages at private island resorts ranging from 200,000-500,000 SCR ($14,800-$37,000 USD). The isolation creates unique traditions: <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-benir-lamer-3913"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_benir_lamer.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="benir lamer - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">benir lamer</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">beh-NEER lah-MEHR</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (sea blessing) ceremonies where couples wade into the ocean for purification, and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-gro-manze-zil-4024"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_gro_manze_zil.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="gro manze zil - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">gro manze zil</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">groh mahn-ZAY zeel</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (island feast) featuring ultra-fresh seafood caught that morning by resort staff.</p>

Limited resources mean simplified <strong>lasosiye</strong> focusing on grilled seafood, tropical fruits, and imported champagne, though costs remain high due to transportation. These intimate celebrations emphasize environmental integration: ceremonies timed with turtle nesting seasons, decorations using endemic flowers like <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bwa-d-nat-4879"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_bwa_d_nat.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bwa-d-nat - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">bwa-d-nat</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bwah-deh-NAHT</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (Wright&rsquo;s gardenia), and <strong>moutya</strong> performed on pristine beaches under stars unmarred by light pollution.</p>

                <h3>Traditional vs Contemporary Expenses</h3>
                <p>Seychellois wedding expenses vary dramatically between traditional home-based celebrations costing 50,000-100,000 SCR ($3,700-$7,400 USD) and luxury resort weddings reaching 300,000-600,000 SCR ($22,200-$44,400 USD) for 150 guests. Traditional celebrations reduce costs through <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-konbit-335"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_konbit.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="konbit - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">konbit</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kohn-BEET</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (community cooperation) where relatives provide free labor for cooking, decorating, and serving, while borrowing <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-materyal-472"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_materyal.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="materyal - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">materyal</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">mah-tehr-YAHL</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (equipment) from churches and community centers. Contemporary weddings require professional services: photographers charging 15,000-40,000 SCR ($1,110-$2,960 USD), videographers at 20,000-50,000 SCR ($1,480-$3,700 USD), and wedding planners commanding 10-15% of total budget.</p>
                <p>The shift toward contemporary celebrations reflects Seychelles&rsquo; growing tourism industry influence and rising disposable incomes averaging 25,000 SCR ($1,850 USD) monthly for middle-class couples. Bank loans specifically for weddings range from 100,000-300,000 SCR ($7,400-$22,200 USD) at 12-15% interest, with Seychelles Commercial Bank and Barclays offering specialized wedding packages. Hidden costs often surprise couples: church flowers (5,000-10,000 SCR), guest transportation between islands (20,000-40,000 SCR), and gratuities for service staff (5-10% of vendor fees). Traditional weddings benefit from <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sousou-1398"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_sousou.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sousou - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">sousou</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">soo-SOO</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (savings circles) where family members contribute monthly amounts toward wedding expenses, reducing reliance on formal loans.</p>
                <h3>Investment Priorities by Tradition</h3>
                <p>Budget allocation reveals cultural priorities: Seychellois couples typically spend 30% on <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-lasosiye-1689"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_lasosiye.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="lasosiye - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">lasosiye</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">lah-soh-SEE-yay</span></span></span></dfn></strong> food and beverages, 20% on venue/decorations, 15% on photography/videography, 15% on attire, 10% on music/entertainment, and 10% on miscellaneous expenses including gifts for wedding party. This contrasts with Western weddings emphasizing venue and photography over food. The <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-gato-marie-1991"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_gato_marie.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="gato marie - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">gato marie</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">gah-toh mah-REE</span></span></span></dfn></strong> alone costs 8,000-20,000 SCR ($590-$1,480 USD) for elaborate designs featuring tropical themes, edible flowers, and minimum four tiers representing the main islands.</p>

Modern additions like photo booths (8,000-15,000 SCR rental), drone videography (10,000-20,000 SCR), and imported flowers (15,000-30,000 SCR) increasingly compete for budget allocation. Couples prioritizing cultural authenticity often sacrifice contemporary elements, choosing community hall venues over hotels to afford traditional music and food prepared by family elders.</p>

                <h3>What is the typical duration of wedding celebrations?</h3>
                <p>Seychellois wedding celebrations typically span 2-3 days for modern weddings or extend to 5-7 days for traditional celebrations incorporating all customs.

Contemporary urban couples increasingly condense celebrations into single-day events due to work commitments and venue constraints, particularly in Victoria where Saturday bookings at popular venues like ICCS or STC Conference Centre require 6-12 month advance reservations.</p>
                <h3>Who typically attends Seychellois weddings?</h3>
                <p>Seychellois weddings typically include 100-300 guests comprising extended family, work colleagues, childhood friends, and neighborhood community members reflecting the islands&rsquo; close-knit society of 98,000 people. Traditional guest lists follow <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-fanmiy-elarz-2216"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_fanmiy_elarz.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="fanmiy elarz - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">fanmiy elarz</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">fahn-mee eh-LAHRZ</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (extended family) concepts including cousins to third degree, godparents and their families, and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-konpann-2343"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_konpann.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="konpann - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">konpann</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kohn-PAHN</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lifelong friends), easily reaching 200+ attendees. The average Seychellois maintains connections across multiple islands, requiring coordination for guests traveling from Praslin, La Digue, or outer islands via ferry (1,000-1,500 SCR per person) or chartered boats. Modern couples face pressure balancing intimate celebrations with social obligations, as excluding distant relatives or neighbors can damage community relationships lasting generations in small island societies.</p>
                <h3>How do costs differ between church and civil ceremonies?</h3>
                <p>Church ceremonies in Seychelles cost 3,000-8,000 SCR ($220-$590 USD) including facility use, organist, and basic decorations, while civil ceremonies charge only 500 SCR ($37 USD) for the legal service at government offices. However, civil ceremonies at special venues like beaches or heritage sites incur additional costs: location permits (5,000-15,000 SCR), registrar travel fees (2,000-5,000 SCR), and required setup like chairs and sound systems (10,000-20,000 SCR). Catholic churches require completion of marriage preparation courses costing 2,000-3,000 SCR ($148-$222 USD) and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bann-3504"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_bann.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bann - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">bann</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bahn</span></span></span></dfn></strong> announcements adding 1,500-3,000 SCR ($111-$222 USD).

                <h3>What are the main differences between traditional and modern celebrations?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Seychellois weddings emphasize community involvement through <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-konbit-4023"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_konbit.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="konbit - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">konbit</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kohn-BEET</span></span></span></dfn></strong> cooperation, home-based <strong>lasosiye</strong> with family-cooked meals, extended multi-day celebrations, and authentic <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-moutya-4170"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_moutya.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="moutya - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">moutya</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">moo-TYAH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances costing 50,000-150,000 SCR ($3,700-$11,100 USD) total. Modern celebrations feature hotel venues, professional catering, condensed single-day timelines, DJ entertainment, and international influences costing 150,000-400,000 SCR ($11,100-$29,600 USD). Traditional weddings maintain <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-benediksyon-granparan-4487"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_benediksyon_granparan.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="benediksyon granparan - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">benediksyon granparan</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">beh-neh-deek-SYOHN grahn-pah-RAHN</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-veye-4527"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_veye.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="veye - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">veye</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-YAY</span></span></span></dfn></strong> gatherings, and gender-separated <strong>entereman</strong> parties, while contemporary couples adopt Western elements like destination photo shoots, cocktail hours, and honeymoon registries.

                <h3>How do Seychellois wedding traditions differ from other island nations?</h3>
                <p>Seychellois weddings blend French Catholic ceremonies, African <strong>moutya</strong> dancing, and British administrative customs, distinguishing them from purely Polynesian (Hawaiian, Tahitian) or Caribbean island traditions. Unlike Hawaiian weddings emphasizing <strong>lei</strong> exchanges and <strong>luau</strong> feasts, Seychellois celebrations center on <strong>lasosiye</strong> Creole cuisine and <strong>sega</strong> music. The <strong>bann</strong> announcement system derives from French colonial law rather than indigenous customs, while <strong>moutya</strong> connects to East African rather than Pacific heritage. Compared to Caribbean islands, Seychelles maintains stronger French influences in food (using terms like <strong>rougay</strong> and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kari-5886"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kari.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kari - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kari</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-REE</span></span></span></dfn></strong>) and Catholic ceremonial elements. The <strong>kado maryaz</strong> gift-giving resembles Mauritian practices due to shared colonial history, but Seychellois weddings uniquely incorporate <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kok-de-mer-6096"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_kok_de_mer.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kok-de-mer - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">kok-de-mer</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kohk-deh-MEHR</span></span></span></dfn></strong> symbolism and specific Indian Ocean island adaptations.</p>
                <h3>What documents are required for marriage in Seychelles?</h3>
                <p>Marriage in Seychelles requires extensive documentation for both <strong>seremoni sivil</strong> and <strong>seremoni legliz</strong>, with citizens needing birth certificates, national identity cards, and single status certificates from the Civil Status Office costing 100 SCR ($7.40 USD) each. Foreign nationals must provide passports, birth certificates with apostille authentication, single status certificates from their home countries, and divorce decrees if applicable, all translated into English by certified translators charging 500-2,000 SCR ($37-$148 USD) per document. Church weddings additionally require baptism certificates, confirmation records, and completion of pre-marriage courses lasting 6-8 weeks. The notice period requires 14 days for citizens or 40 days for foreigners, with applications submitted to Victoria Civil Status Office or district branches. Special considerations apply for outer island ceremonies requiring documented transportation arrangements and designated celebrant availability.</p>
                <h3>How long do couples typically plan their weddings?</h3>
                <p>Seychellois couples typically plan weddings over 6-12 months, with popular venues like L&rsquo;Archipel or Savoy Resort requiring 8-12 month advance bookings for peak season (April-May, September-November) Saturdays. Traditional planning begins with <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-fiyansay-7592"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_fiyansay.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="fiyansay - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">fiyansay</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">fee-yan-SAY</span></span></span></dfn></strong> engagement 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time>, allowing time for <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sousou-7696"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/CRS-SC_sousou.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sousou - click to hear pronunciation" lang="CR"><strong class="term-text">sousou</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">soo-SOO</span></span></span></dfn></strong> savings accumulation, <strong>bann</strong> church announcements (minimum 3 weeks), and coordination with off-island relatives. Modern couples using wedding planners may compress timelines to 3-6 months, though costs increase 20-30% for rush arrangements. Critical timing considerations include avoiding monsoon seasons affecting outdoor venues, coordinating with fishing seasons for fresh seafood <strong>lasosiye</strong>, and booking authentic <strong>moutya</strong> troupes who maintain full calendars during wedding season. International guests require 2-3 months notice for visa applications and flight arrangements to Seychelles&rsquo; limited air connections.</p>
                <h3>What role do parents play in wedding planning?</h3>
                <p>Parents traditionally finance and organize major portions of Seychellois weddings, with mothers leading <strong>lasosiye</strong> food preparation and fathers managing logistics like venue setup and transportation. The bride&rsquo;s parents historically cover reception costs while the groom&rsquo;s family provides the new couple&rsquo;s first home furnishings, though modern couples increasingly share expenses proportionally based on financial capacity. Parental involvement extends beyond funding: mothers coordinate female relatives for <strong>konbit</strong> cooking sessions, fathers negotiate with vendors using established community relationships, and both sets of parents participate in <strong>fiyansay</strong> negotiations determining wedding scale and traditions to maintain. Contemporary tensions arise when young couples prefer modern elements while parents insist on traditional <strong>moutya</strong>, extended guest lists including distant relatives, or specific <strong>treter</strong> who prepared their own wedding feasts decades ago.</p>
                <h3>How have wedding traditions changed since independence?</h3>
                <p>Since Seychelles&rsquo; 1976 independence, wedding traditions evolved from colonial-influenced ceremonies toward celebrating Creole identity while embracing modern globalization. Pre-independence weddings strictly followed French Catholic protocols with European classical music, formal Western attire despite tropical climate, and French cuisine prominence at receptions. Post-independence cultural renaissance revived <strong>moutya</strong> performances previously discouraged by colonial authorities, established <strong>sega</strong> as primary wedding music replacing European waltzes, and prioritized Creole language in ceremonies over French or English. The 1980s socialist period emphasized community celebrations at public venues over private luxury, while 1990s economic liberalization introduced resort weddings and professional wedding services. Recent decades witness fusion approaches: couples maintaining <strong>benediksyon granparan</strong> and <strong>lasosiye</strong> traditions while adding Instagram-worthy beach photo shoots, destination wedding packages, and international DJ music alongside traditional <strong>sega</strong> bands.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in [Las Vegas](las-vegas-wedding-traditions.html), don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave [us](american-wedding-traditions.html) such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from [Scotland](scottish-wedding-traditions.html) and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
