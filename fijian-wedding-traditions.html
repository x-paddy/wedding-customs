                <p>Cash gifts are preferred at Fijian weddings, typically FJ$50-500 (USD $25-250) depending on relationship closeness. Present money in envelopes during the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-veiyabaki-2314"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/FJ-FJ_veiyabaki.mp3" data-definition="money dance" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="veiyabaki - click to hear pronunciation" lang="FJ"><strong class="term-text">veiyabaki</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">vay-yahm-BAH-kee</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-veiyabaki-2314" class="definition-inline">money dance</span></dfn> or in gift boxes at reception. Traditional gifts include tapa cloth, woven mats, or household items. Wrapped presents are also acceptable.</p>
                <h3>7. Is alcohol served at Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Alcohol service varies by family preference and religious background. Methodist and other Christian weddings often exclude alcohol, while Hindu and secular celebrations may include it. Kava serves as the traditional ceremonial drink regardless of alcohol presence. Resort weddings typically offer full bar service unless specifically requested otherwise.</p>
                <h3>8. What&rsquo;s the difference between <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-itaukei-2936"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/FJ-FJ_itaukei.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="iTaukei - click to hear pronunciation" lang="FJ"><strong class="term-text">iTaukei</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ee-TAU-kay</span></span></span></dfn> and Indo-Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>iTaukei (indigenous Fijian) weddings emphasize traditional ceremonies like sevusevu, meke performances, and lovo feasts, typically lasting multiple days. Indo-Fijian weddings incorporate Hindu or Muslim traditions with <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mehndi-3197"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-FJ_mehndi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mehndi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">mehndi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MEHN-dee</span></span></span></dfn>, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-baraat-3205"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-FJ_baraat.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="baraat - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">baraat</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">buh-RAHT</span></span></span></dfn> processions, and Indian cuisine, sometimes blending with Fijian elements. Both value extended family participation and multi-day celebrations.</p>
                <h3>9. When is the best time of year for a Fijian wedding?</h3>
                <p>May through October offers Fiji&rsquo;s dry season with temperatures 18-26°C (65-79°F), ideal for outdoor ceremonies. November through April brings higher humidity and cyclone risk but fewer tourists and lower venue prices. School holidays (December-January, April, July) see higher local wedding demand and prices.</p>
                <h3>10. How do we plan a Fijian wedding from overseas?</h3>
                <p>Planning from overseas requires 6-12 months preparation. Start by choosing between resort packages (FJ$5,000-50,000) offering coordination services or hiring local wedding planners (FJ$2,000-5,000 fees). Video consultations, digital contracts, and advance venue visits help. Consider legal requirements: visitors can marry in Fiji with proper documentation including birth certificates and single status affidavits.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave [us](american-wedding-traditions.html) such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from [Scotland](scottish-wedding-traditions.html) and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a traditional Fijian wedding actually cost?</h3>
                <p>The answer might surprise you—traditional Fijian weddings cost between FJ$10,000-60,000 ($5,000-$30,000 USD), but here&#x27;s the twist: village weddings often cost less than resort ceremonies despite feeding triple the guests. How? Community magic. In villages, families contribute labor, food, and supplies, bringing a FJ$30,000 wedding down to FJ$8,000-15,000 in actual cash spent. Your cousin provides the lovo(earth oven) expertise, aunties weave mats as gifts, and the village hall comes free with elder approval. Resort weddings flip the script—you&#x27;re paying FJ$20,000-50,000 for convenience, but missing the controlled chaos of 200 relatives arguing over lovo pit placement. Pro tip: Even &quot;simple&quot; beach ceremonies with warriors and meke(traditional dance) run FJ$15,000 minimum once you add traditional elements that make it authentically Fijian.</p>
                <h3>What is a &#x27;vakamau&#x27; in Fijian culture?</h3>
                <p>A &#x27;vakamau&#x27; is the traditional Fijian wedding ceremony that represents the sacred union of families and communities, often lasting several days or weeks.</p>
                <h3>What exactly is kava and do I have to drink it?</h3>
                <p>Great question that every first-time guest asks! Kava (yaqona in Fijian) is a mildly narcotic drink made from crushed pepper plant roots mixed with water, tasting like muddy water met a peppercorn at a bad party. The sevusevu(kava ceremony) isn&#x27;t just a drink—it&#x27;s THE ritual that officially opens any Fijian gathering. Yes, you should drink it when offered (refusing is like declining communion at a Catholic wedding). The effects? A slight numbing of lips and tongue, mild relaxation, and membership in an ancient tradition. Don&#x27;t worry about getting &quot;drunk&quot;—wedding kava is usually mixed lighter than everyday drinking kava. The real challenge isn&#x27;t the effects but the taste. Smile, clap three times before drinking, once after, and know that your grimace becomes part of family lore.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of the tabua in Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>The tabua (whale&#x27;s tooth) is a precious ceremonial gift presented by the groom&#x27;s family during the &#x27;dulumi&#x27; to request permission for marriage.</p>
                <h3>Why do Fijian weddings last so many days?</h3>
                <p>Think of Fijian weddings as Netflix series rather than movies—each day serves a purpose in the marriage story. Traditional celebrations span 3-7 days because you&#x27;re not just joining two people but merging entire family networks. Day one might be tevutevu(mat ceremony) where families size each other up through gift quality. Day two brings religious ceremonies. Day three features the reception with lovo feasts. Days four through seven? Extended family events, farewell ceremonies, and recovery from the previous days. Modern couples often compress to 1-3 days, but even &quot;simplified&quot; versions include pre-wedding rituals, the ceremony, reception, and farewell traditions. The extended timeline also accommodates relatives traveling from other islands—when your aunt boats in from Kadavu, you don&#x27;t rush her back after one meal.</p>
                <h3>What traditional attire do Fijian brides wear?</h3>
                <p>Fijian brides typically wear a masi dress or skirt, adorned with shells and natural fibers, complemented by a salusalu (flower garland).</p>
                <h3>Can non-Fijians have a traditional Fijian wedding?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Non-Fijians frequently incorporate traditional elements, especially at resort weddings where cultural fusion is the norm. Popular additions include simplified sevusevu ceremonies (15 minutes versus traditional 45), bili bili(warrior escort) entrances for dramatic effect (FJ$500-1,500), meke performances during receptions (FJ$500-2,000), and lovo feasts that wow international guests. The key is respecting traditions while adapting them appropriately. Resort coordinators excel at creating culturally respectful versions—warriors still chant authentically, but they&#x27;ll explain meanings in English. About 70% of destination weddings include at least three traditional elements. Most Fijians appreciate interest in their culture when done respectfully. Skip the tabua(whale tooth) exchange unless you have Fijian family, but absolutely include the flower salusalu(lei) ceremony.</p>
                <h3>What is the &#x27;yaqona&#x27; ceremony?</h3>
                <p>The yaqona (kava) ceremony is a crucial unity ritual during Fijian weddings, symbolizing respect and community blessing.</p>
                <h3>What should wedding guests wear to respect traditions?</h3>
                <p>Dress codes at Fijian weddings balance tradition, modesty, and tropical reality. Women should wear dresses or sulus(sarongs) covering shoulders and knees—think elegant resort wear, not beach casual. Bright tropical colors celebrate the setting, but avoid white (bride&#x27;s color) or black (funeral associations). Men wear dress shirts with formal sulus or lightweight trousers—ties melt in humidity, so skip them unless specified. For Indo-Fijian weddings, embrace color! Women often wear saris or lehengas (rentable in Suva for FJ$100-300), while men sport kurtas or formal shirts. 

Key rules: Remove shoes when entering homes or ceremonial spaces (bring nice socks), dress modestly for religious portions, and pack a shawl for air-conditioned venues. That stunning sundress with spaghetti straps? Save it for the honeymoon. Pro tip: Bring two outfits—formal for ceremony, comfortable for hours of dancing.</p>
                <h3>How long do traditional Fijian weddings last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Fijian weddings can span several days or weeks, involving extensive community participation and celebrations.</p>
                <h3>What are appropriate wedding gifts in Fijian culture?</h3>
                <p>Cash reigns supreme at Fijian weddings, typically FJ$50-500 ($25-$250 USD) depending on your relationship and wallet depth. Present money in a nice envelope during the veiyabaki(money dance) or in decorated gift boxes at the reception. Traditional gifts include tapa cloth (masi), woven mats, or household items, but modern couples prefer money to establish their homes. For Indo-Fijian weddings, gold jewelry or cash in odd number amounts (FJ$51, $101) brings luck. 

Avoid clocks (symbolizing death), knives (cutting relationships), or handkerchiefs (tears). If you&#x27;re international guests, quality items from your homeland make thoughtful presents—just ensure they&#x27;re practical, not dust collectors. Register gifts exist but feel impersonal in communal cultures. When in doubt, crisp bills in a beautiful envelope with a heartfelt card never offend.</p>
                <h3>What is &#x27;solesolevaki&#x27; in Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Solesolevaki refers to the communal effort where the entire village helps with wedding preparations and celebrations.</p>
                <h3>Is alcohol served at Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>The alcohol question divides Fijian weddings more than lovo versus buffet debates. Many iTaukei families, particularly Methodist ones, exclude alcohol entirely—kava provides the social lubricant. Hindu weddings might include alcohol, while Muslim celebrations definitely don&#x27;t. Secular and resort weddings typically offer full bar service. The key? Read the room (or invitation). If the wedding&#x27;s at a church hall with prominent kava bowls, it&#x27;s probably dry. Resort venues usually clarify alcohol policies upfront.

Even at weddings with bars, kava takes precedence culturally. You&#x27;ll insult no one by sticking to juice and kava. However, arriving intoxicated to any portion commits serious cultural sins. Some modern couples compromise—no alcohol during ceremonies and formal dinners, but open bar for late-night dancing. When alcohol is served, Fiji Bitter and rum dominate, though international wines appear at upscale events.</p>
                <h3>What is served at a Fijian wedding feast?</h3>
                <p>The traditional feast (magiti) includes lovo-cooked foods (underground oven), seafood, and local delicacies.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s the deal with whale teeth at weddings?</h3>
                <p>The tabua(whale tooth) isn&#x27;t just valuable—it&#x27;s Fijian culture&#x27;s crown jewel, the ultimate symbol of respect. These polished sperm whale teeth, worth FJ$300-3,000 ($150-$1,500 USD), serve as engagement rings, ceremony openers, and apology offerings rolled into one sacred object. Traditionally, grooms&#x27; families present tabua during marriage proposals. Refusing one equals refusing the proposal—no pressure! 

Modern laws restrict whale tooth trade, making inherited tabua precious family heirlooms. At weddings, tabua presentations mark major moments: opening ceremonies, uniting families, blessing couples. The presentation involves specific protocols—trained speakers, formal language, careful handling. Non-Fijians shouldn&#x27;t attempt buying or presenting tabua unless guided by Fijian family. Think of them as Fijian culture&#x27;s version of Excalibur—powerful, ancient, and definitely not found on Amazon.</p>
                <h3>What is &#x27;meke&#x27; in Fijian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Meke refers to traditional Fijian dances performed during wedding celebrations as entertainment and cultural expression.</p>
                <h3>How do destination wedding packages handle traditions?</h3>
                <p>Resort packages masterfully balance authenticity with tourist-friendly timing, offering traditional elements in digestible portions. Basic packages (FJ$5,000-10,000) might include simplified sevusevu lasting 15 minutes and tropical flower arrangements. Mid-tier options (FJ$15,000-25,000) add warrior escorts, 20-minute meke performances, and lovo feast samples. Luxury packages (FJ$30,000-50,000) provide full traditional experiences with extended ceremonies, multiple costume changes, and elaborate cultural performances.

Resorts employ cultural advisors ensuring respectful adaptations. Warriors perform authentic chants but explain meanings in English. Kava ceremonies maintain proper protocols while accommodating guests unfamiliar with clapping sequences. The lovo feast follows traditional preparation but meets international food safety standards. About 85% of destination couples add at least one traditional element, with warrior escorts and sunset kava ceremonies most popular. Packages typically include coordination, setup, performers, and someone to explain what&#x27;s happening to confused relatives.</p>
                <h3>What is the &#x27;duguci&#x27; ceremony?</h3>
                <p>Duguci is the formal engagement ceremony marked by elaborate gift-giving between families.</p>
                <h3>When&#x27;s the best time of year for a Fijian wedding?</h3>
                <p>May through October wins for weather—Fiji&#x27;s dry season brings comfortable 18-26°C (65-79°F) temperatures, minimal rain, and humidity that won&#x27;t destroy hairstyles. May and September offer the sweet spot: perfect weather before peak tourist prices. November through April means higher humidity, potential cyclones, but 20-30% lower venue costs and fewer tourist crowds.

Avoid: December-January (peak tourism plus school holidays), Easter week (religious complications), and February-March (cyclone roulette). Local pro tip: Fijians prefer Saturday weddings, making Fridays and Sundays 10-15% cheaper at venues. Full moons hold special significance—ceremonies under moonlight cost more but create magic. 

Weather wildcard: Fiji&#x27;s microclimates mean Coral Coast might pour while Denarau Island stays dry. Island ceremonies need weather backup plans—nothing dampens warrior entrances like torrential rain. Book May or September for optimal conditions, but pack an umbrella regardless. The good news? Even rainy Fijian weddings become adventures guests reminisce about forever.</p>
                <h3>How are modern Fijian weddings different?</h3>
                <p>Modern Fijian weddings blend traditional elements with contemporary practices like Western attire and modern music while maintaining core cultural rituals.</p>

<script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a traditional Fijian wedding actually cost?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The answer might surprise you—traditional Fijian weddings cost between FJ$10,000-60,000 ($5,000-$30,000 USD), but here's the twist: village weddings often cost less than resort ceremonies despite feeding triple the guests. How? Community magic. In villages, families contribute labor, food, and supplies, bringing a FJ$30,000 wedding down to FJ$8,000-15,000 in actual cash spent. Your cousin provides the lovo(earth oven) expertise, aunties weave mats as gifts, and the village hall comes free with elder approval. Resort weddings flip the script—you're paying FJ$20,000-50,000 for convenience, but missing the controlled chaos of 200 relatives arguing over lovo pit placement. Pro tip: Even \"simple\" beach ceremonies with warriors and meke(traditional dance) run FJ$15,000 minimum once you add traditional elements that make it authentically Fijian."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a 'vakamau' in Fijian culture?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A 'vakamau' is the traditional Fijian wedding ceremony that represents the sacred union of families and communities, often lasting several days or weeks."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What exactly is kava and do I have to drink it?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Great question that every first-time guest asks! Kava (yaqona in Fijian) is a mildly narcotic drink made from crushed pepper plant roots mixed with water, tasting like muddy water met a peppercorn at a bad party. The sevusevu(kava ceremony) isn't just a drink—it's THE ritual that officially opens any Fijian gathering. Yes, you should drink it when offered (refusing is like declining communion at a Catholic wedding). The effects? A slight numbing of lips and tongue, mild relaxation, and membership in an ancient tradition. Don't worry about getting \"drunk\"—wedding kava is usually mixed lighter than everyday drinking kava. The real challenge isn't the effects but the taste. Smile, clap three times before drinking, once after, and know that your grimace becomes part of family lore."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the significance of the tabua in Fijian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The tabua (whale's tooth) is a precious ceremonial gift presented by the groom's family during the 'dulumi' to request permission for marriage."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Why do Fijian weddings last so many days?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Think of Fijian weddings as Netflix series rather than movies—each day serves a purpose in the marriage story. Traditional celebrations span 3-7 days because you're not just joining two people but merging entire family networks. Day one might be tevutevu(mat ceremony) where families size each other up through gift quality. Day two brings religious ceremonies. Day three features the reception with lovo feasts. Days four through seven? Extended family events, farewell ceremonies, and recovery from the previous days. Modern couples often compress to 1-3 days, but even \"simplified\" versions include pre-wedding rituals, the ceremony, reception, and farewell traditions. The extended timeline also accommodates relatives traveling from other islands—when your aunt boats in from Kadavu, you don't rush her back after one meal."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What traditional attire do Fijian brides wear?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Fijian brides typically wear a masi dress or skirt, adorned with shells and natural fibers, complemented by a salusalu (flower garland)."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can non-Fijians have a traditional Fijian wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Absolutely! Non-Fijians frequently incorporate traditional elements, especially at resort weddings where cultural fusion is the norm. Popular additions include simplified sevusevu ceremonies (15 minutes versus traditional 45), bili bili(warrior escort) entrances for dramatic effect (FJ$500-1,500), meke performances during receptions (FJ$500-2,000), and lovo feasts that wow international guests. The key is respecting traditions while adapting them appropriately. Resort coordinators excel at creating culturally respectful versions—warriors still chant authentically, but they'll explain meanings in English. About 70% of destination weddings include at least three traditional elements. Most Fijians appreciate interest in their culture when done respectfully. Skip the tabua(whale tooth) exchange unless you have Fijian family, but absolutely include the flower salusalu(lei) ceremony."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the 'yaqona' ceremony?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The yaqona (kava) ceremony is a crucial unity ritual during Fijian weddings, symbolizing respect and community blessing."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What should wedding guests wear to respect traditions?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Dress codes at Fijian weddings balance tradition, modesty, and tropical reality. Women should wear dresses or sulus(sarongs) covering shoulders and knees—think elegant resort wear, not beach casual. Bright tropical colors celebrate the setting, but avoid white (bride's color) or black (funeral associations). Men wear dress shirts with formal sulus or lightweight trousers—ties melt in humidity, so skip them unless specified. For Indo-Fijian weddings, embrace color! Women often wear saris or lehengas (rentable in Suva for FJ$100-300), while men sport kurtas or formal shirts. \n\nKey rules: Remove shoes when entering homes or ceremonial spaces (bring nice socks), dress modestly for religious portions, and pack a shawl for air-conditioned venues. That stunning sundress with spaghetti straps? Save it for the honeymoon. Pro tip: Bring two outfits—formal for ceremony, comfortable for hours of dancing."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do traditional Fijian weddings last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Fijian weddings can span several days or weeks, involving extensive community participation and celebrations."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are appropriate wedding gifts in Fijian culture?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cash reigns supreme at Fijian weddings, typically FJ$50-500 ($25-$250 USD) depending on your relationship and wallet depth. Present money in a nice envelope during the veiyabaki(money dance) or in decorated gift boxes at the reception. Traditional gifts include tapa cloth (masi), woven mats, or household items, but modern couples prefer money to establish their homes. For Indo-Fijian weddings, gold jewelry or cash in odd number amounts (FJ$51, $101) brings luck. \n\nAvoid clocks (symbolizing death), knives (cutting relationships), or handkerchiefs (tears). If you're international guests, quality items from your homeland make thoughtful presents—just ensure they're practical, not dust collectors. Register gifts exist but feel impersonal in communal cultures. When in doubt, crisp bills in a beautiful envelope with a heartfelt card never offend."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is 'solesolevaki' in Fijian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Solesolevaki refers to the communal effort where the entire village helps with wedding preparations and celebrations."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is alcohol served at Fijian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The alcohol question divides Fijian weddings more than lovo versus buffet debates. Many iTaukei families, particularly Methodist ones, exclude alcohol entirely—kava provides the social lubricant. Hindu weddings might include alcohol, while Muslim celebrations definitely don't. Secular and resort weddings typically offer full bar service. The key? Read the room (or invitation). If the wedding's at a church hall with prominent kava bowls, it's probably dry. Resort venues usually clarify alcohol policies upfront.\n\nEven at weddings with bars, kava takes precedence culturally. You'll insult no one by sticking to juice and kava. However, arriving intoxicated to any portion commits serious cultural sins. Some modern couples compromise—no alcohol during ceremonies and formal dinners, but open bar for late-night dancing. When alcohol is served, Fiji Bitter and rum dominate, though international wines appear at upscale events."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is served at a Fijian wedding feast?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The traditional feast (magiti) includes lovo-cooked foods (underground oven), seafood, and local delicacies."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What's the deal with whale teeth at weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The tabua(whale tooth) isn't just valuable—it's Fijian culture's crown jewel, the ultimate symbol of respect. These polished sperm whale teeth, worth FJ$300-3,000 ($150-$1,500 USD), serve as engagement rings, ceremony openers, and apology offerings rolled into one sacred object. Traditionally, grooms' families present tabua during marriage proposals. Refusing one equals refusing the proposal—no pressure! \n\nModern laws restrict whale tooth trade, making inherited tabua precious family heirlooms. At weddings, tabua presentations mark major moments: opening ceremonies, uniting families, blessing couples. The presentation involves specific protocols—trained speakers, formal language, careful handling. Non-Fijians shouldn't attempt buying or presenting tabua unless guided by Fijian family. Think of them as Fijian culture's version of Excalibur—powerful, ancient, and definitely not found on Amazon."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is 'meke' in Fijian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Meke refers to traditional Fijian dances performed during wedding celebrations as entertainment and cultural expression."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do destination wedding packages handle traditions?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Resort packages masterfully balance authenticity with tourist-friendly timing, offering traditional elements in digestible portions. Basic packages (FJ$5,000-10,000) might include simplified sevusevu lasting 15 minutes and tropical flower arrangements. Mid-tier options (FJ$15,000-25,000) add warrior escorts, 20-minute meke performances, and lovo feast samples. Luxury packages (FJ$30,000-50,000) provide full traditional experiences with extended ceremonies, multiple costume changes, and elaborate cultural performances.\n\nResorts employ cultural advisors ensuring respectful adaptations. Warriors perform authentic chants but explain meanings in English. Kava ceremonies maintain proper protocols while accommodating guests unfamiliar with clapping sequences. The lovo feast follows traditional preparation but meets international food safety standards. About 85% of destination couples add at least one traditional element, with warrior escorts and sunset kava ceremonies most popular. Packages typically include coordination, setup, performers, and someone to explain what's happening to confused relatives."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the 'duguci' ceremony?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Duguci is the formal engagement ceremony marked by elaborate gift-giving between families."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "When's the best time of year for a Fijian wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "May through October wins for weather—Fiji's dry season brings comfortable 18-26°C (65-79°F) temperatures, minimal rain, and humidity that won't destroy hairstyles. May and September offer the sweet spot: perfect weather before peak tourist prices. November through April means higher humidity, potential cyclones, but 20-30% lower venue costs and fewer tourist crowds.\n\nAvoid: December-January (peak tourism plus school holidays), Easter week (religious complications), and February-March (cyclone roulette). Local pro tip: Fijians prefer Saturday weddings, making Fridays and Sundays 10-15% cheaper at venues. Full moons hold special significance—ceremonies under moonlight cost more but create magic. \n\nWeather wildcard: Fiji's microclimates mean Coral Coast might pour while Denarau Island stays dry. Island ceremonies need weather backup plans—nothing dampens warrior entrances like torrential rain. Book May or September for optimal conditions, but pack an umbrella regardless. The good news? Even rainy Fijian weddings become adventures guests reminisce about forever."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are modern Fijian weddings different?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Modern Fijian weddings blend traditional elements with contemporary practices like Western attire and modern music while maintaining core cultural rituals."}}]}</script>
