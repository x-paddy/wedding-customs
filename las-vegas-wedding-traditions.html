<p>Every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day, someone gets married in Las Vegas. That&rsquo;s 288 weddings before most cities serve breakfast. Since 1931, when <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nevada-956"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Nevada - click to hear pronunciation" lang="es"><strong class="term-text">Nevada</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nuh-VAD-uh</span></span></span></dfn> shortened its residency requirement for divorce (inadvertently creating the wedding industry), over 2 million couples have said &ldquo;I do&rdquo; in the self-proclaimed Wedding Capital of the World-and here&rsquo;s the shocking part: these marriages have similar success rates to traditional weddings. The difference? Vegas couples actually remember enjoying their wedding day.
Whether you&rsquo;re dreaming of a $200 USD quickie ceremony, saying your vows in the tropical oasis of <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-glass-gardens-1446"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Glass Gardens - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Glass Gardens</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">glass GAR-denz</span></span></span></dfn> at <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-chapel-of-the-flowers-1463"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Chapel of the Flowers - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Chapel of the Flowers</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">CHAP-el uv thuh FLOW-erz</span></span></span></dfn>, or experiencing the brand-new Garden of Lights at EverAfter (where 50,000 LED lights create your own personalized light show), Vegas has perfected the art of making marriage memorable. No blood tests, no waiting periods, no judgment-just pure celebration on your terms. And yes, your <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-officiant-1770"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="officiant - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">officiant</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">uh-FISH-unt</span></span></span></dfn> might be wearing blue suede shoes, or they might be performing your ceremony under a canopy of synchronized starlight.
The magic isn&rsquo;t just the convenience-it&rsquo;s the permission to be completely yourself. Want a zombie-themed wedding at 3 AM? There&rsquo;s a chapel for that. Dreaming of exchanging vows while flying over the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-grand-canyon-2116"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Grand Canyon - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Grand Canyon</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">grand KAN-yun</span></span></span></dfn>? Helicopters leave hourly. Vegas has been the place where love makes its own rules for nearly a century.

                💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: The Marriage License Bureau now has a location AT the airport (Terminal 1, near baggage claim). You can literally get your marriage license before your Uber arrives. Open daily 8 AM - midnight (hours subject to change).
                What truly sets Vegas apart isn&rsquo;t just the convenience-it&rsquo;s the quality you can achieve without the typical wedding planning nightmare.

For just $102 USD and about 15 minutes of your time (down from 30 minutes pre-2020), you&rsquo;ll receive the document that makes it all legal. No blood tests, no waiting periods, no residency requirements-just bring valid ID and your partner.
                ⚡ <strong>Quick Warning</strong>: The bureau closes at midnight (2 AM on Fridays/Saturdays), but lines can stretch 2+ hours on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; dates (7/7, 8/8, 10/10, 11/11, 12/12). Avoid the 5-7 PM rush by going early morning or late evening. Or use the new airport location!
                ℹ️ <strong>Good to Know</strong>: PreRegister online at the Clark County website to save 10 minutes. You&rsquo;ll still need to appear in person, but your info will already be in the system. Both parties must be present-no proxies allowed! License expires after one year if unused.
                The building itself has become an inadvertent museum of modern love. Couples from over 100 countries queue up daily, creating a United Nations of romance. Listen closely and you&rsquo;ll hear nervous giggles in Japanese, marriage proposals in Spanish (yes, some people propose IN LINE), and excited chatter in languages you can&rsquo;t identify.

                📌 <strong>Important Note</strong>: International couples need passports, not just driver&rsquo;s licenses. Also, if previously married, you need the official divorce decree with the judge&rsquo;s signature and court seal-not just the filing paperwork! Name changes are handled through Social Security and DMV after the wedding, not at the license bureau.</p>

                <p>Forget everything you think you know about Vegas wedding chapels. In 1999, Chapel of the Flowers did something revolutionary-they built Glass Gardens, a venue that would redefine what a Vegas wedding could be. This isn&rsquo;t just another chapel; it&rsquo;s where over 100,000 couples have discovered that &ldquo;Vegas wedding&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to mean &ldquo;Vegas kitsch.&rdquo;
                <strong>What Makes Glass Gardens the Ultimate Vegas Chapel:</strong>
                Picture exchanging vows in what feels like a secret tropical oasis, where living walls of orchids and birds of paradise frame your ceremony, while a glass <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-atrium-719"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="atrium - click to hear pronunciation" lang="la"><strong class="term-text">atrium</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">AY-tree-um</span></span></span></dfn> ceiling reveals the Vegas sky above. The genius of Glass Gardens is how it delivers that &ldquo;destination wedding in Bali&rdquo; feeling while being literally on <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-las-vegas-boulevard-890"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Las Vegas Boulevard - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Las Vegas Boulevard</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">lahs VAY-gus BOO-luh-vard</span></span></span></dfn>. Natural light floods the space during day ceremonies (revolutionary for Vegas), while at night, thousands of tiny lights transform it into an enchanted forest.
                🌺 <strong>The Glass Gardens Difference</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>FREE professional wedding planner</strong>: Every Glass Gardens booking includes a dedicated coordinator who handles everything-no extra charge (this alone is worth $2,000-$5,000 USD elsewhere)</li>
                <li><strong>Living plants everywhere</strong>: Not silk, not plastic-actual tropical gardens thriving in the desert (they employ two full-time horticulturists)</li>
                <li><strong>Climate-controlled perfection</strong>: 72°F year-round while it&rsquo;s 115°F outside</li>
                <li><strong>That waterfall</strong>: A real cascading water feature that drowns out Strip noise and creates perfect ambiance</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity flexibility</strong>: Intimate with 2, magical with 20, magnificent with 70</li>
                <li><strong>The light</strong>: Photographers literally cry with joy-natural light + professional lighting = no bad photos</li>
                <li><strong>The sound system</strong>: Crystal-clear audio means everyone hears your vows, not slot machines</li>
                <li><strong>The privacy</strong>: Completely enclosed, no random tourists peeking in</li>
                <li><strong>Free parking</strong>: Rare on <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-the-strip-2216"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="the Strip - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">the Strip</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">thuh strip</span></span></span></dfn>, stress-free for guests
                💰 <strong>Budget Alert</strong>: Glass Gardens packages start at $795 USD for basic ceremonies but average $2,000-$3,500 USD for the full experience with flowers, photography, and streaming. Considering couples get photos that look like they flew to a tropical resort (minus the $10,000 USD travel costs), it&rsquo;s Vegas&rsquo;s best wedding value.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Garden of Lights at EverAfter: Vegas&rsquo;s Newest Instagram Sensation</h3>

                <li><strong>Holographic elements</strong>: Optional 3D effects for dramatic entrances</li>
                <li><strong>Climate-controlled</strong>: Perfect 72°F regardless of desert heat</li>

                <strong>Why Couples Are Choosing Garden of Lights</strong>:</li>
                <li>First venue to offer completely customizable lighting themes</li>

                <p>4.9/5 stars across all platforms
                💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Book Glass Gardens ceremonies for late afternoon (3-5 PM) when the natural light is absolutely perfect, or evening (7-9 PM) when the lights create magic. Avoid noon-2 PM in summer when even the glass ceiling can&rsquo;t soften that desert sun completely.
                The secret? Glass Gardens solved the fundamental problem of Vegas weddings: how to be convenient and magical, spontaneous and sophisticated, fun and meaningful. You can literally walk in wearing jeans, and their team will have you photo-ready in their salon, married in their garden paradise, and celebrating with <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-champagne-5969"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/FR-USLV_champagne.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="champagne - click to hear pronunciation" lang="fr"><strong class="term-text">champagne</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sham-PAYN</span></span></span></dfn> in under 2 hours-yet it feels like you planned it for months.

                <h3>The Original Vegas Wedding Chapels-Where Legends Were Born</h3>
                <p>Stand-alone wedding chapels are the beating heart of Vegas matrimony. These aren&rsquo;t your grandmother&rsquo;s churches-they&rsquo;re theatrical venues where love meets showmanship, and somehow it works perfectly. The Little Church of the West, built in 1942, sits on the National Register of Historic Places and has hosted everyone from Elvis Presley himself (to Ann-Margret) to modern celebrities trying to recapture old Hollywood glamour.
                🎵 <strong>Musical Note</strong>: The organs in historic chapels like <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-graceland-8195"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Graceland - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Graceland</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">GRAYS-land</span></span></span></dfn> are often original 1940s Wurlitzers. Their slightly off-key charm has soundtracked over 500,000 ceremonies-imperfection making perfection. That wobbling note during &ldquo;Here Comes the Bride&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s history, baby.
                Walking into these chapels feels like stepping onto a movie set designed by someone who understood that weddings should be fun, not stuffy. Red <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-velvet-8578"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="velvet - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">velvet</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">VEL-vit</span></span></span></dfn> pews that have supported countless couples, crystal chandeliers that have witnessed six decades of &ldquo;I dos,&rdquo; and artificial flowers that never wilt (because who wants to deal with allergies during vows?) create a timeless backdrop.</p>
                <h3>Chapel of the Flowers: The Vegas Venue That Changed Everything</h3>
                <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the crown jewel that revolutionized Vegas weddings: <strong>Chapel of the Flowers</strong>. This isn&rsquo;t just another Vegas chapel-it&rsquo;s a full-scale wedding destination that&rsquo;s been perfecting the art of &ldquo;elegant meets fun&rdquo; since
                1960. While other chapels were racing to the bottom with &ldquo;$99 specials,&rdquo; Chapel of the Flowers went the opposite direction: what if a Vegas wedding could be both spontaneous AND sophisticated?
                Spread across two acres on the Strip, this family-owned venue offers not one but THREE distinct chapels, but let&rsquo;s be honest-<strong>Glass Gardens is the star that steals the show</strong>:
                🌺 <strong>The Glass Gardens Chapel</strong> (The Crown Jewel): This is it-the chapel that ruins all other chapels for you. Picture saying &ldquo;I do&rdquo; surrounded by live tropical plants and cascading waterfalls under a glass atrium ceiling that frames the Vegas sky. It&rsquo;s like getting married in a botanical garden that happens to be in the middle of the desert. The natural light during day ceremonies is photographer&rsquo;s gold, while evening ceremonies feel like a midsummer night&rsquo;s dream. Holds up to 70 guests, but even with just two people, it feels perfectly intimate, not empty. <strong>This is why people fly to Vegas specifically</strong>-not for Elvis, not for drive-thrus, but for Glass Gardens.
                💎 <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-la-capella-10326"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="La Capella - click to hear pronunciation" lang="it"><strong class="term-text">La Capella</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">lah kah-PEL-ah</span></span></span></dfn> Chapel</strong>: Italian Renaissance meets Vegas glamour with hand-painted frescos, <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-venetian-10421"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Venetian - click to hear pronunciation" lang="en"><strong class="term-text">Venetian</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">vuh-NEE-shun</span></span></span></dfn> chandeliers, and enough romantic ambiance to make even your cynical brother-in-law tear up. This is where couples go when they want traditional beauty without traditional hassle. Capacity: 50 guests.
                🌹 <strong>The Victorian Chapel</strong>: Intimate and ornate with just 30 seats, perfect for couples who want that classic chapel feel with elevated style. Original stained glass from the 1960s, restored vintage organ, and woodwork that belongs in a museum.
                <strong>Why Chapel of the Flowers (Especially Glass Gardens) Dominates:</strong>
                💰 <strong>Budget Alert</strong>: Chapel of the Flowers packages start at $495 USD but Glass Gardens packages average $2,000-$3,500 USD for the full experience. Worth it? When your photos look like a $20,000 USD destination wedding at 10% of the cost-absolutely. They&rsquo;re transparent about pricing (rare in Vegas) with no hidden &ldquo;minister fees&rdquo; or &ldquo;suggested donations.&rdquo;</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>FREE wedding planner with every package</strong> (worth $2,000-$5,000 USD at traditional venues-they handle everything from timeline to vendor coordination)</li>
                <li><strong>Only venue with an on-site professional florist</strong> creating fresh bouquets daily (crucial for Glass Gardens&rsquo; living garden aesthetic)</li>
                <li><strong>Their own hair and makeup salon</strong> because you want to look as good as the venue</li>
                <li><strong>Live streaming studio</strong> with broadcast-quality equipment ($150 USD-grandma watches from her living room)</li>
                <li><strong>Professional wedding coordinators</strong> who&rsquo;ve orchestrated over 750,000 weddings (100,000+ in Glass Gardens alone)</li>
                <li><strong>On-site photography studio</strong> with perfect lighting for portraits after your garden ceremony</li>
                <li><strong>Private bridal <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-suite-12232"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="suite - click to hear pronunciation" lang="fr"><strong class="term-text">suite</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sweet</span></span></span></dfn></strong> where you&rsquo;re not competing with five other brides for mirror space
                The best part? They treat every couple like VIPs, whether you&rsquo;re spending $500 USD or $5,000 USD. No assembly-line feeling, no rush to get you out for the next couple-just genuine care from a team that&rsquo;s been family-operated for three generations. <strong>Glass Gardens specifically maintains 30-minute buffers between ceremonies</strong> so you never feel rushed and never see another wedding party.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Chapel Landscape: Your Complete Guide</h3>
                <p>📌 <strong>Important Note: The Glass Gardens vs Garden of Lights Decision</strong>
                Before you tour 20 chapels, know this: Vegas now has two garden-themed showstoppers.

                <h3>LGBTQ+ Weddings: Vegas Has Always Been Proud</h3>
                <p>Long before marriage equality became law nationwide, Vegas was already saying &ldquo;love is love&rdquo; with open arms and rainbow chapel doors. The city that never judges has been performing commitment ceremonies since the 1990s and legal same-sex marriages since October 2014-with the same enthusiasm they bring to everything else.
                🏳️‍🌈 <strong>Pride Note</strong>: Several chapels specialize in LGBTQ+ ceremonies with specific packages, pride decor options, and officiants who genuinely celebrate your love.

                What makes Vegas special for LGBTQ+ couples:</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bouquet-19335"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/FR-USLV_bouquet.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bouquet - click to hear pronunciation" lang="fr"><strong class="term-text">bouquet</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">boo-KAY</span></span></span></dfn>.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-limousine-20725"><span class="audio-term" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="limousine - click to hear pronunciation" lang="fr"><strong class="term-text">limousine</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LIM-uh-zeen</span></span></span></dfn> was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Las Vegas wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>Las Vegas weddings range from $75 for a basic ceremony at the courthouse to $50,000+ for luxury chapel experiences. Standard chapel packages cost $200-$2,000, including ceremony, flowers, photography, and sometimes Elvis. Drive-through weddings run $75-$200, while helicopter weddings over the Strip cost $2,000-$5,000. All-inclusive resort packages range from $1,500-$10,000. The beauty is you can get married on any budget—from a $99 special to a Bellagio extravaganza.</p>
                <h3>How long does it take to get a marriage license in Las Vegas?</h3>
                <p>Las Vegas is famous for instant marriage licenses—no waiting period, no blood tests, just $102 and valid ID. The Marriage License Bureau is open daily until midnight (2 AM on weekends), processing licenses in 15-30 minutes. You&#x27;ll need government-issued photo ID and, if previously married, know your divorce date. The license is valid for one year in Nevada. Pro tip: pre-register online to skip lines, especially on Valentine&#x27;s Day or New Year&#x27;s Eve.</p>
                <h3>Can you really get married by Elvis in Las Vegas?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Elvis ceremonies are a Vegas tradition since the 1970s, with over 100 Elvis officiants citywide. Packages range from $199 for young Elvis to $500+ for jumpsuit Elvis with full concert. Popular chapels like Graceland Wedding Chapel and Viva Las Vegas offer multiple Elvis eras. The King will sing 3-4 songs, walk you down the aisle, and officiate vows. Some couples choose dueling Elvises or Elvis with showgirls. It&#x27;s kitschy, fun, and surprisingly emotional when done well.</p>
                <h3>What are the most famous Las Vegas wedding chapels?</h3>
                <p>The Little White Wedding Chapel (open 24/7) has married everyone from Britney Spears to Frank Sinatra. Graceland Wedding Chapel specializes in Elvis ceremonies since 1947. Chapel of the Flowers (littlechapel.com) is the top-rated chapel on TripAdvisor, offering elegant garden ceremonies and live-streaming services. A Little White Chapel provides traditional elegance with Victorian charm. Viva Las Vegas features themed weddings from Gothic to Western. For unique venues, try Neon Museum ($2,500+), Valley of Fire ($500+), or helicopter weddings over the Strip. Each chapel has its specialty—research reviews and packages carefully.</p>
                <h3>Do Las Vegas weddings count as legal marriages?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Las Vegas marriages are 100% legally binding everywhere when properly conducted. You need: valid marriage license ($102), authorized officiant, and legal ceremony with vows. Nevada doesn&#x27;t require witnesses, though most chapels provide them. International couples may need apostilled documents for home country recognition. Same-sex marriages have been legal since 2014. The only &#x27;fake&#x27; weddings are commitment ceremonies explicitly marketed as non-legal. Your Vegas marriage certificate is as valid as any courthouse wedding.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s included in typical Las Vegas wedding packages?</h3>
                <p>Basic packages ($200-$500) include: 10-minute ceremony, officiant, witness, music, and certificate holder. Mid-range packages ($500-$1,500) add: photography (10-50 images), flowers, video, limo service, and champagne toast. Premium packages ($1,500-$5,000) include: extended photography, hair/makeup, custom flowers, reception space, and themed elements. Many chapels offer all-inclusive deals covering hotel, ceremony, and dinner. Always clarify what&#x27;s included—some charge extra for everything from music to walking down the aisle.</p>
                <h3>Can you have a traditional wedding in Las Vegas?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Beyond the stereotypes, Vegas offers stunning traditional venues. Luxury hotels like Bellagio, Wynn, and Four Seasons host elegant ceremonies for 20-500 guests in gardens, terraces, and ballrooms. Prices range from $2,000-$50,000+. Lake Las Vegas provides Mediterranean-style venues 30 minutes from the Strip. Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire offer breathtaking outdoor ceremonies. Many couples do morning adventure weddings then evening receptions. Vegas has world-class vendors for any style—just expect 20-30% markup over other cities.</p>
                <h3>What are the best months to get married in Las Vegas?</h3>
                <p>March-May and September-November offer perfect weather (70-85°F) for outdoor ceremonies. Avoid June-August when temperatures hit 115°F unless staying indoors. December-February can be surprisingly cold (40-60°F) but has holiday charm. Peak seasons are Valentine&#x27;s Day, New Year&#x27;s Eve, and convention weeks when prices double and availability shrinks. Cheapest times are July-August and mid-week ceremonies. Special dates like 7/7, 10/10, or 12/12 book months ahead. Consider weather, crowds, and significance when choosing.</p>
                <h3>Do you need witnesses for a Las Vegas wedding?</h3>
                <p>Nevada law doesn&#x27;t require witnesses, but most venues provide or require one witness for documentation. Chapels typically include a witness in packages or charge $25-$50 for staff witnesses. If bringing your own, they must be 18+ with valid ID. Some couples use taxi drivers, tourists, or Elvis impersonators as witnesses for fun stories. High-end venues often require two witnesses. International couples should check home country requirements—some need two witnesses for recognition.</p>
