                <h3>What is a tamada and why are they important?</h3>
                <p>A tamada (ka_ta-ma-da) is the Georgian toastmaster who orchestrates the entire wedding feast through eloquent speeches, managing 20-30 formal toasts over 6-12 hours. The tamada controls wine flow, feast pacing, and celebration energy, making them essential to successful Georgian weddings. Professional tamadas charge $500-$2,000, while family tamadas receive gifts worth $200-$500.</p>
                <h3>Do Georgian weddings require both civil and religious ceremonies?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Georgian law requires a civil ceremony for legal marriage recognition, costing 100-200 GEL ($35-70 USD) at Houses of Justice or Marriage. While religious ceremonies are optional, 85% of couples choose Orthodox Christian ceremonies (costing $200-$1,000) or other religious services based on their faith, making both ceremonies standard practice.</p>
                <h3>What are the essential pre-wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Georgian pre-wedding traditions include <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-machankloba-1821"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/KA-GE_machankloba.mp3" data-definition="matchmaking" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="machankloba - click to hear pronunciation" lang="KA"><strong class="term-text">machankloba</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">mats-khan-klo-ba</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-machankloba-1821" class="definition-inline">matchmaking</span></dfn> occurring 12-<time datetime="P6M">6 months before</time> the wedding, and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nishnoba-1921"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/KA-GE_nishnoba.mp3" data-definition="engagement ceremony" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nishnoba - click to hear pronunciation" lang="KA"><strong class="term-text">nishnoba</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nish-no-ba</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-nishnoba-1921" class="definition-inline">engagement ceremony</span></dfn> held 3-6 months prior with 50-150 guests. These events cost $500-$5,000 combined and involve gift exchanges including gold jewelry, wine, and ceremonial items, plus family investigation and approval processes.</p>
                <h3>What should guests expect at a Georgian wedding supra?</h3>
                <p>Wedding guests experience a 6-12 hour feast featuring 15-20 courses, unlimited wine (2-3 liters per person average), and 20-30 ceremonial toasts led by the tamada. Expect traditional Georgian dishes, multiple wine varieties, live music, traditional dancing, and celebrations lasting until dawn. Gifts typically range from $100-$500 per couple.</p>
                <h3>Are Georgian wedding dances performed by everyone?</h3>
                <p>While professional dancers perform complex traditional dances like <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kartuli-2711"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/KA-GE_kartuli.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Kartuli - click to hear pronunciation" lang="KA"><strong class="term-text">Kartuli</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kar-tu-li</span></span></span></dfn> and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-khorumi-2723"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/KA-GE_khorumi.mp3" data-definition="costing $500-$1,500 for hire" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Khorumi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="KA"><strong class="term-text">Khorumi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kho-ru-mi</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-khorumi-2723" class="definition-inline">costing $500-$1,500 for hire</span></dfn>, guests participate in simpler group dances throughout the celebration. Most Georgians learn basic wedding dances in childhood, and the party atmosphere encourages everyone to join, regardless of skill level.</p>
                <h3>What&rsquo;s the significance of breaking a plate at Georgian weddings?</h3>
                <p>The plate-breaking ceremony symbolizes breaking with past lives and beginning the couple&rsquo;s union, bringing prosperity and warding off evil spirits. Performed at the reception venue entrance witnessed by all 200-500 guests, this 5-minute tradition uses decorative plates ($20-$50) and provides a key photo opportunity marking the celebration&rsquo;s official beginning.</p>
                <h3>Can foreigners have a Georgian-style wedding?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Many international couples choose Georgian-style weddings, either in Georgia or abroad. Key elements to include: hiring a tamada, preparing a proper supra feast, incorporating traditional toasts, serving Georgian wine, and including at least one traditional dance performance. Costs outside Georgia vary but authentic elements can be arranged through Georgian diaspora communities.</p>
                <h3>What happens the day after a Georgian wedding?</h3>
                <p>The day after features namtsetsoba (ka_nam-tsets-o-ba), the &ldquo;leftovers day&rdquo; where 30-50 close family members gather informally to eat remaining food, open gifts, share stories, and strengthen family bonds. This 4-6 hour gathering requires no additional cost and allows intimate family connection without the main celebration&rsquo;s formality.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Georgian wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>The answer might surprise you—traditional Georgian weddings cost $15,000-$50,000 USD total, while urban Tbilisi celebrations average $30,000-$80,000 USD. The breakdown reveals why: venues run $3,000-$20,000 USD, catering at $50-$150 USD per guest feeds 200-500 attendees, wine service adds $2,000-$10,000 USD, entertainment costs $1,500-$5,000 USD, and traditional elements like tamada fees ($500-$2,000 USD) and dance performances ($500-$1,500 USD) complete the budget. Pro tip: Start saving when you start dating—Georgian weddings don&#x27;t do &quot;simple.&quot;</p>
                <h3>What is a Georgian &#x27;Tamada&#x27; and why are they important?</h3>
                <p>A Tamada is a traditional Georgian toastmaster who leads the wedding feast (supra). They&#x27;re chosen for their wisdom, wit, and public speaking skills, orchestrating toasts and maintaining the celebration&#x27;s flow and energy.</p>
                <h3>How long do Georgian weddings last?</h3>
                <p>Simply put, Georgian weddings last 12-24 hours, beginning with morning ceremonies and continuing until sunrise or beyond. The main supra feast alone runs 6-12 hours, though mountain region weddings can extend across 3-5 days. The following day includes namtsetsoba (leftovers day) lasting another 4-6 hours with close family. Consider training your stamina like an athlete—you&#x27;ll need endurance levels usually reserved for ultramarathons.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of the crown ceremony in Georgian weddings?</h3>
                <p>The crown ceremony (gvirgvini) symbolizes the couple&#x27;s spiritual union and their role as king and queen of their new household. Crowns are held above the couple&#x27;s heads throughout the Orthodox ceremony.</p>
                <h3>What is a tamada and why are they important?</h3>
                <p>Great question—a tamada(toastmaster) is the Georgian wedding&#x27;s conductor, orchestrating the entire feast through eloquent speeches over 6-12 hours. They manage 20-30 formal toasts, control wine flow and pacing, and maintain celebration energy when normal humans would collapse. Professional tamadas charge $500-$2,000 USD while family tamadas receive gifts worth $200-$500 USD. Without a skilled tamada, your wedding feast becomes a directionless dinner party. With one, it transforms into an unforgettable journey through emotion, tradition, and strategic intoxication.</p>
                <h3>How long does a traditional Georgian wedding celebration last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Georgian weddings often last 2-3 days, though modern celebrations are typically condensed into one full day of festivities, including the ceremony and elaborate supra feast.</p>
                <h3>Do Georgian weddings require both civil and religious ceremonies?</h3>
                <p>The answer involves both law and culture. Georgian law requires civil ceremonies for legal recognition, costing just 100-200 GEL ($35-70 USD) at Houses of Justice or Marriage. While religious ceremonies remain technically optional, 85% of couples include Orthodox Christian ceremonies (costing $200-$1,000 USD) or other religious services, making both ceremonies standard practice. Think of it this way: the civil ceremony makes it legal, but the religious ceremony makes it legitimate in grandmother&#x27;s eyes.</p>
                <h3>What is the traditional Georgian wedding dress (Kartuli)?</h3>
                <p>The Kartuli is an elegant white dress featuring intricate embroidery, often adorned with red and white accessories. It&#x27;s complemented by a traditional headdress called Tavsaburavi.</p>
                <h3>What are the essential pre-wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Many people wonder about this, and the timeline matters. Georgian pre-wedding traditions include machankloba(matchmaking) occurring 12-6 months before the wedding—even for couples who met on Tinder. Then comes nishnoba(engagement ceremony) 3-6 months prior with 50-150 guests, essentially a practice wedding. These events cost $500-$5,000 USD combined and involve gift exchanges including gold jewelry ($500-$2,000 USD), ceremonial wine, and extensive family negotiations. Skip these at your own risk—Georgian mothers have long memories.</p>
                <h3>What role does wine play in Georgian wedding celebrations?</h3>
                <p>Wine is central to Georgian weddings, symbolizing life and prosperity. Special toasts are made throughout the celebration, often using family-made wine served in traditional vessels.</p>
                <h3>What should guests expect at a Georgian wedding supra?</h3>
                <p>Prepare for a 6-12 hour feast featuring 15-20 courses and unlimited wine (averaging 2-3 liters per person). You&#x27;ll experience 20-30 ceremonial toasts led by the tamada(toastmaster), traditional Georgian dishes arriving in relentless waves, multiple wine varieties, live music, and dancing until dawn. Gifts typically range from $100-$500 USD per couple. Insider advice: Eat the bread between toasts, wear comfortable shoes, and never try to keep pace with the grandmother at your table—she&#x27;s been training for decades.</p>
                <h3>What is the &#x27;Maqari&#x27; in Georgian weddings?</h3>
                <p>The Maqari is the traditional wedding procession where the wedding party parades through streets with music and dance, symbolizing the community&#x27;s involvement in the celebration.</p>
                <h3>Are Georgian wedding dances performed by everyone?</h3>
                <p>The answer reveals Georgian social dynamics beautifully. Professional dancers perform complex traditional dances like kartuli(romantic dance) and khorumi(war dance), costing $500-$1,500 USD for hired troupes. However, guests participate in simpler group dances throughout the celebration. Most Georgians learn basic wedding dances in childhood, and the party atmosphere encourages everyone to join regardless of skill. After enough wine and encouragement from aunties, even the shyest international guests find themselves attempting Georgian moves.</p>
                <h3>Are arranged marriages still common in Georgia?</h3>
                <p>While arranged marriages were once traditional, they are now rare in modern Georgia. However, family approval and involvement in the marriage process remain important.</p>
                <h3>What&#x27;s the significance of breaking a plate at Georgian weddings?</h3>
                <p>This moment carries more weight than its 5-minute duration suggests. The plate-breaking ceremony symbolizes breaking with past lives and beginning the couple&#x27;s union, theoretically bringing prosperity and warding off evil spirits. Performed at the reception entrance before all 200-500 guests, couples smash decorative plates ($20-$50 USD) creating both symbolic moment and photo opportunity. One crucial detail: the plate must break properly on first attempt, or superstitious grandmothers will insist on repeating until achieved correctly.</p>
                <h3>What types of gifts are traditional at Georgian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Traditional gifts include monetary contributions, family heirlooms, handcrafted items, and wine. Modern couples may also have wedding registries or prefer cash gifts.</p>
                <h3>Can foreigners have a Georgian-style wedding?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely, and many international couples choose this unforgettable option! Key elements to include: hiring a proper tamada(toastmaster) who can manage multilingual toasts, preparing an authentic supra feast with 15-20 courses, incorporating traditional toast sequences, serving Georgian wine (budget $2,000-$5,000 USD), and including at least one traditional dance performance. Costs outside Georgia vary, but authentic elements can be arranged through Georgian diaspora communities worldwide. Fair warning: once your family experiences a Georgian wedding, all future celebrations will seem disappointingly brief.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of the &#x27;Kheli Tkhova&#x27; ceremony?</h3>
                <p>Kheli Tkhova is the formal hand-asking ceremony where the groom&#x27;s family visits the bride&#x27;s family to request permission for marriage, bringing traditional gifts and sweets.</p>
                <h3>What happens the day after a Georgian wedding?</h3>
                <p>The celebration continues with namtsetsoba(leftovers day), where 30-50 close family members gather informally to decompress, eat remaining food (there&#x27;s always plenty), and share stories that couldn&#x27;t be told during formal toasts. This 4-6 hour gathering requires no additional cost and allows intimate family bonding without ceremonial pressure. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll hear what really happened during hour 10 of the feast, why Uncle Giorgi was dancing on the table, and which cousin caught the bride&#x27;s bouquet after diving across three aunties. Consider it group therapy with exceptional food.</p>
                <h3>How are Georgian wedding traditions adapting to modern times?</h3>
                <p>While maintaining core cultural elements, modern Georgian weddings often incorporate international trends, professional planning, social media sharing, and shorter celebration timeframes.</p>

The breakdown reveals why: venues run $3,000-$20,000 USD, catering at $50-$150 USD per guest feeds 200-500 attendees, wine service adds $2,000-$10,000 USD, entertainment costs $1,500-$5,000 USD, and traditional elements like tamada fees ($500-$2,000 USD) and dance performances ($500-$1,500 USD) complete the budget. Pro tip: Start saving when you start dating—Georgian weddings don't do \"simple.\""}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a Georgian 'Tamada' and why are they important?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A Tamada is a traditional Georgian toastmaster who leads the wedding feast (supra). They're chosen for their wisdom, wit, and public speaking skills, orchestrating toasts and maintaining the celebration's flow and energy."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do Georgian weddings last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Simply put, Georgian weddings last 12-24 hours, beginning with morning ceremonies and continuing until sunrise or beyond. The main supra feast alone runs 6-12 hours, though mountain region weddings can extend across 3-5 days. The following day includes namtsetsoba (leftovers day) lasting another 4-6 hours with close family. Consider training your stamina like an athlete—you'll need endurance levels usually reserved for ultramarathons."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the significance of the crown ceremony in Georgian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The crown ceremony (gvirgvini) symbolizes the couple's spiritual union and their role as king and queen of their new household. Crowns are held above the couple's heads throughout the Orthodox ceremony."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a tamada and why are they important?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Great question—a tamada(toastmaster) is the Georgian wedding's conductor, orchestrating the entire feast through eloquent speeches over 6-12 hours. They manage 20-30 formal toasts, control wine flow and pacing, and maintain celebration energy when normal humans would collapse. Professional tamadas charge $500-$2,000 USD while family tamadas receive gifts worth $200-$500 USD. Without a skilled tamada, your wedding feast becomes a directionless dinner party. With one, it transforms into an unforgettable journey through emotion, tradition, and strategic intoxication."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does a traditional Georgian wedding celebration last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Georgian weddings often last 2-3 days, though modern celebrations are typically condensed into one full day of festivities, including the ceremony and elaborate supra feast."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Georgian weddings require both civil and religious ceremonies?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The answer involves both law and culture. Georgian law requires civil ceremonies for legal recognition, costing just 100-200 GEL ($35-70 USD) at Houses of Justice or Marriage. While religious ceremonies remain technically optional, 85% of couples include Orthodox Christian ceremonies (costing $200-$1,000 USD) or other religious services, making both ceremonies standard practice. Think of it this way: the civil ceremony makes it legal, but the religious ceremony makes it legitimate in grandmother's eyes."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the traditional Georgian wedding dress (Kartuli)?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Kartuli is an elegant white dress featuring intricate embroidery, often adorned with red and white accessories. It's complemented by a traditional headdress called Tavsaburavi."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are the essential pre-wedding traditions?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Many people wonder about this, and the timeline matters. Georgian pre-wedding traditions include machankloba(matchmaking) occurring 12-6 months before the wedding—even for couples who met on Tinder. Then comes nishnoba(engagement ceremony) 3-6 months prior with 50-150 guests, essentially a practice wedding. These events cost $500-$5,000 USD combined and involve gift exchanges including gold jewelry ($500-$2,000 USD), ceremonial wine, and extensive family negotiations. Skip these at your own risk—Georgian mothers have long memories."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What role does wine play in Georgian wedding celebrations?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Wine is central to Georgian weddings, symbolizing life and prosperity. Special toasts are made throughout the celebration, often using family-made wine served in traditional vessels."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What should guests expect at a Georgian wedding supra?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Prepare for a 6-12 hour feast featuring 15-20 courses and unlimited wine (averaging 2-3 liters per person). You'll experience 20-30 ceremonial toasts led by the tamada(toastmaster), traditional Georgian dishes arriving in relentless waves, multiple wine varieties, live music, and dancing until dawn. Gifts typically range from $100-$500 USD per couple. Insider advice: Eat the bread between toasts, wear comfortable shoes, and never try to keep pace with the grandmother at your table—she's been training for decades."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the 'Maqari' in Georgian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Maqari is the traditional wedding procession where the wedding party parades through streets with music and dance, symbolizing the community's involvement in the celebration."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are Georgian wedding dances performed by everyone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The answer reveals Georgian social dynamics beautifully. Professional dancers perform complex traditional dances like kartuli(romantic dance) and khorumi(war dance), costing $500-$1,500 USD for hired troupes. However, guests participate in simpler group dances throughout the celebration. Most Georgians learn basic wedding dances in childhood, and the party atmosphere encourages everyone to join regardless of skill. After enough wine and encouragement from aunties, even the shyest international guests find themselves attempting Georgian moves."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are arranged marriages still common in Georgia?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "While arranged marriages were once traditional, they are now rare in modern Georgia. However, family approval and involvement in the marriage process remain important."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What's the significance of breaking a plate at Georgian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "This moment carries more weight than its 5-minute duration suggests. The plate-breaking ceremony symbolizes breaking with past lives and beginning the couple's union, theoretically bringing prosperity and warding off evil spirits. Performed at the reception entrance before all 200-500 guests, couples smash decorative plates ($20-$50 USD) creating both symbolic moment and photo opportunity. One crucial detail: the plate must break properly on first attempt, or superstitious grandmothers will insist on repeating until achieved correctly."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What types of gifts are traditional at Georgian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional gifts include monetary contributions, family heirlooms, handcrafted items, and wine. Modern couples may also have wedding registries or prefer cash gifts."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can foreigners have a Georgian-style wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Absolutely, and many international couples choose this unforgettable option! Key elements to include: hiring a proper tamada(toastmaster) who can manage multilingual toasts, preparing an authentic supra feast with 15-20 courses, incorporating traditional toast sequences, serving Georgian wine (budget $2,000-$5,000 USD), and including at least one traditional dance performance. Costs outside Georgia vary, but authentic elements can be arranged through Georgian diaspora communities worldwide.

This 4-6 hour gathering requires no additional cost and allows intimate family bonding without ceremonial pressure. It's when you'll hear what really happened during hour 10 of the feast, why Uncle Giorgi was dancing on the table, and which cousin caught the bride's bouquet after diving across three aunties. Consider it group therapy with exceptional food."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are Georgian wedding traditions adapting to modern times?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "While maintaining core cultural elements, modern Georgian weddings often incorporate international trends, professional planning, social media sharing, and shorter celebration timeframes."}}]}</script>
