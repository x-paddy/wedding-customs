            <h2 class="accordion">Pre-Wedding Traditions and Ceremonies</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Bride Price (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tafuliae-17"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ARE-SB_tafuliae.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Tafuliae - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Tafuliae</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tah-foo-LEE-ay</span></span></span></dfn>): The Traditional Marriage Payment System</h3>
                <p><strong>Bride price</strong> is a customary payment tradition that compensates the bride&rsquo;s family for their loss, typically occurring 3-<time datetime="P6M">6 months before</time> the wedding and involving negotiations between 10-20 family representatives.</p>
                <h4>Cost and Duration</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional cost</strong>: 50,000-200,000 SBD ($6,000-$24,000 USD)</li>
                <li><strong>Shell money component</strong>: 10-50 strings of tafuliae valued at 500-2,000 SBD per string</li>
                <li><strong>Duration</strong>: 2-6 months of negotiations</li>
                <li><strong>Participants</strong>: 10-30 family members from both sides</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Bride Price Process</h4>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Initial approach</strong>: Male family elders send representatives to bride&rsquo;s family</li>
                <li><strong>Formal negotiations</strong>: Both families meet to discuss compensation amounts</li>
                <li><strong>Payment agreement</strong>: Specific items listed including shell money, pigs, and cash</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange ceremony</strong>: Public presentation of bride price validates the engagement</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Regional Variations</h4>
                <p><strong>Malaita bride price</strong> requires traditional shell money (tafuliae) as the primary component, with families spending months crafting these valuable items. The process involves specialized artisans who create intricate patterns representing family histories.</p>
                <p><strong>Western Province customs</strong> differ by emphasizing carved items and woven goods alongside monetary payments, typically totaling 30,000-100,000 SBD ($3,600-$12,000 USD).</p>
                <p><strong>Shortland Islands exception</strong> stands unique as the only region without bride price traditions, where marriages proceed through mutual family agreements without formal compensation.</p>
                <h4>Modern Adaptations</h4>
                <p>Contemporary families increasingly negotiate flexible payment plans:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Installment payments over 6-12 months</li>
                <li>Reduced amounts for educated couples (30-50% less)</li>
                <li>Symbolic shell money combined with practical gifts</li>
                <li>Church mediation for disputes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: Core practice of family compensation remains unchanged despite payment flexibility.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kastomu-2296"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_kastomu.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Kastomu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">Kastomu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kas-TOH-moo</span></span></span></dfn> Meetings: Traditional Family Negotiations</h3>
                <p><strong>Kastomu meetings</strong> are formal gatherings where both families discuss marriage arrangements, typically occurring over 3-5 sessions spanning 2-3 months and involving clan leaders and elders.</p>
                <h4>Meeting Structure and Costs</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Meeting frequency</strong>: 3-5 formal sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Duration per meeting</strong>: 4-6 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Kola nut expenses</strong>: 500-1,000 SBD per meeting</li>
                <li><strong>Total negotiation costs</strong>: 5,000-10,000 SBD ($600-$1,200 USD)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Traditional Protocol</h4>
                <ol>
                <li><strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tok-save-2937"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_tok_save.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Tok save - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">Tok save</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tohk SAH-veh</span></span></span></dfn></strong>: Initial informal inquiry through intermediaries</li>
                <li><strong>Formal request</strong>: Male family presents betel nut and announces intentions</li>
                <li><strong>Bride&rsquo;s family consultation</strong>: Private discussions lasting 1-2 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Response ceremony</strong>: Acceptance or rejection communicated formally</li>
                <li><strong>Terms negotiation</strong>: Detailed discussions of expectations and obligations</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The kastomu process connects to the subsequent bride price negotiations, establishing the foundation for lifelong family relationships beyond the immediate couple.</p>
                <h3>Pre-Wedding Feast Preparations</h3>
                <p><strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-motu-3623"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_motu.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Motu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">Motu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MOH-too</span></span></span></dfn> preparation</strong> is a communal cooking tradition using earth ovens, typically beginning 3 days before the wedding and involving 50-100 community members preparing food for 200-500 guests.</p>
                <h4>Preparation Timeline and Costs</h4>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Food procurement</strong>: 20,000-50,000 SBD ($2,400-$6,000 USD)</li>
                <li><strong>Pig purchases</strong>: 5-10 pigs at 2,000-5,000 SBD each</li>
                <li><strong>Root crop gathering</strong>: 3 days with 20-30 helpers</li>
                <li><strong>Coconut collection</strong>: 200-500 nuts for cooking and drinking</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Women prepare traditional puddings while men construct the motu and gather firewood, demonstrating gender-specific roles that reinforce community bonds through shared labor.</p>

                <h3>Social Media and Technology Integration</h3>
                <p><strong>Digital documentation</strong> is the modern practice of sharing wedding celebrations online, with 70% of urban couples hiring photographers and videographers for 5,000-20,000 SBD ($600-$2,400 USD).</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Rural areas increasingly adopt basic photography services, though traditional oral sharing of wedding stories remains important for community bonding.</p>
                <h3>International Wedding Alternatives</h3>
                <p><strong>Destination weddings</strong> are ceremonies held outside Solomon Islands, with <a href="las-vegas-wedding-traditions.html">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="fijian-wedding-traditions.html">Fiji</a> being popular choices among diaspora couples, typically costing $2,000-$10,000 USD including travel.</p>

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a typical Solomon Islands wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>The total cost of a Solomon Islands wedding ranges from 100,000-400,000 SBD ($12,000-$48,000 USD), including bride price (50,000-200,000 SBD), feast preparations (30,000-80,000 SBD), church and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kastom-260"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_kastom.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kastom - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">kastom</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KAS-tom</span></span></span></dfn> ceremonies (15,000-40,000 SBD), and attire (10,000-30,000 SBD). Urban weddings in Honiara typically cost 20-30% more due to venue rentals and professional services. Costs vary significantly based on family expectations, with Malaita weddings requiring higher shell money investments while Western Province ceremonies emphasize feast expenses. Modern couples often reduce costs through extended payment plans and simplified ceremonies.</p>
                <h3>How long does a traditional Solomon Islands wedding last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Solomon Islands weddings typically span 3-7 days, with preparations beginning months in advance. The main celebration includes a church ceremony (2-3 hours), kastom rituals (4-6 hours), and feast activities extending over 2-3 days. Malaita Province weddings often last 5-7 days due to elaborate shell money presentations, while urban Honiara weddings compress activities into 1-2 days. Pre-wedding negotiations and preparations require 3-6 months, with bride price discussions alone taking 2-3 months. Post-wedding welcome ceremonies in the groom&rsquo;s village add another 1-2 days to the total celebration period.</p>
                <h3>What is <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tafuliae-1421"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ARE-SB_tafuliae.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tafuliae - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">tafuliae</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tah-foo-LEE-ay</span></span></span></dfn> and why is it important in Solomon Islands weddings?</h3>
                <p>Tafuliae is traditional shell money crafted from specific shells found in Langalanga Lagoon, Malaita Province, serving as the primary currency for bride price payments and ceremonial exchanges. Creating tafuliae requires 2-6 months of specialized labor, with strings valued at 500-2,000 SBD each depending on quality and pattern complexity. During weddings, families present 10-50 strings of tafuliae worth 10,000-100,000 SBD total, demonstrating wealth and honoring traditions. The shell money represents more than monetary value-each pattern tells family histories and creates lasting bonds between clans. Modern weddings still require tafuliae in Malaita, though other provinces may substitute cash or goods.</p>
                <h3>Who typically attends a Solomon Islands wedding?</h3>
                <p>Solomon Islands weddings involve entire communities, with guest lists ranging from 200-500 people including extended family, clan members, village residents, and church congregations. Traditional protocol requires inviting all relatives within third-cousin relationships, village chiefs, church leaders, and families who previously invited the couple&rsquo;s families to their celebrations. Urban weddings average 150-300 guests due to venue constraints, while rural ceremonies can exceed 500 attendees. The bride and groom&rsquo;s immediate families typically comprise 50-100 guests, with each side contributing equally to the total attendance. Community participation remains essential, as weddings represent alliances between families rather than just individual unions.</p>
                <h3>What happens during a kastom wedding ceremony?</h3>
                <p>Kastom ceremonies begin at dawn with elder blessings using traditional leaves and protection rituals, followed by formal presentations where the bride wears <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kaleko-3262"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_kaleko.mp3" data-definition="grass skirts" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kaleko - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">kaleko</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kah-LEH-koh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-kaleko-3262" class="definition-inline">grass skirts</span></dfn> and shell ornaments worth 10,000-30,000 SBD. Traditional dancers perform gender-specific routines for 2-3 hours, with warrior dances demonstrating protection and women&rsquo;s dances celebrating fertility. Families exchange gifts including pigs, shell money, and woven goods valued at 20,000-50,000 SBD total. Elders deliver pronouncements in local languages, validating the marriage according to traditional law. The ceremony concludes with communal feasting from the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-motu-3753"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_motu.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="motu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">motu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MOH-too</span></span></span></dfn>, where sharing food cements the new family alliance.</p>
                <h3>How do bride price negotiations work?</h3>
                <p>Bride price negotiations begin with <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tok-save-3901"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_tok_save.mp3" data-definition="informal inquiries" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tok save - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">tok save</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">tohk SAH-veh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-tok-save-3901" class="definition-inline">informal inquiries</span></dfn> through intermediaries, followed by 3-5 formal <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kastomu-3978"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/PIS-SB_kastomu.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kastomu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="PI"><strong class="term-text">kastomu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kas-TOH-moo</span></span></span></dfn> meetings over 2-3 months involving 10-20 family representatives from each side. Initial meetings establish willingness to proceed, with families sharing betel nut and discussing general expectations. Subsequent sessions detail specific payments: cash amounts (30,000-150,000 SBD), shell money requirements (10-50 strings), pigs (5-10 animals), and other goods. Negotiations consider the bride&rsquo;s education, family status, and regional customs. Churches increasingly mediate disputes, promoting reasonable amounts. Final agreements are witnessed publicly, with partial payments often made immediately and balances due before the wedding ceremony.</p>
                <h3>What are the main differences between urban and rural weddings?</h3>
                <p>Urban weddings in Honiara feature hotel venues (10,000-30,000 SBD), professional services, and compressed 1-2 day celebrations for 150-300 guests, costing 50,000-150,000 SBD total. Rural weddings maintain traditional 3-7 day celebrations with 300-500+ participants, emphasizing community preparation and kastom elements, costing 80,000-250,000 SBD primarily for feast expenses. Urban ceremonies prioritize convenience with catered meals and hired entertainment, while rural events involve weeks of communal cooking and traditional performances. Photography and social media feature prominently in cities, whereas rural areas focus on oral traditions and community participation. Urban couples often separate civil, church, and traditional ceremonies across different dates, while rural weddings integrate all elements into extended celebrations.</p>
                <h3>Can foreigners have a traditional Solomon Islands wedding?</h3>
                <p>Foreigners can participate in traditional Solomon Islands weddings by partnering with local cultural organizations or tourism operators offering authentic ceremony packages priced at $2,000-$10,000 USD. Papatura Island Resort provides comprehensive packages including kastom performers, traditional war canoe arrivals, shell money presentations, and feast preparations for up to 100 guests. Legal requirements include 21-day residency before civil ceremonies, though cultural celebrations can proceed immediately. Foreign couples should engage cultural advisors (1,000-3,000 SBD daily) to ensure respectful protocol adherence. Some elements like bride price may be modified to symbolic exchanges, while maintaining ceremonial authenticity through traditional music, dance, and feast components.</p>
                <h3>What role does Christianity play in modern Solomon Islands weddings?</h3>
                <p>Christianity influences 95% of Solomon Islands weddings, with church ceremonies being essential components costing 5,000-15,000 SBD including fees, decorations, and choir payments. Most couples blend Christian services with kastom elements, creating syncretic celebrations that honor both spiritual traditions. Anglican ceremonies in Isabel Province incorporate traditional chants, while Catholic weddings in Malaita include shell money offerings. Some evangelical denominations discourage bride price and elaborate kastom rituals, promoting simpler ceremonies focused on Christian vows. Churches provide premarital counseling and often mediate family negotiations. The typical wedding includes morning church services (2-3 hours) followed by afternoon kastom ceremonies, demonstrating how Christianity complements rather than replaces traditional practices.</p>
                <h3>How have Solomon Islands wedding traditions changed since 2020?</h3>
                <p>Post-2020 adaptations include increased technology use, with 60% of urban weddings incorporating livestreaming for overseas relatives unable to travel due to restrictions. Virtual bride price negotiations via WhatsApp video calls have become acceptable, reducing travel costs by 10,000-20,000 SBD. Feast sizes decreased from 400-500 to 200-300 guests, with families saving 20,000-40,000 SBD on food expenses. Compressed celebration timeframes from 5-7 days to 2-3 days accommodate health protocols. Photography packages now include social media coordination for remote participation. Traditional elements like shell money exchanges and kastom dances remain unchanged, but modern couples increasingly choose hybrid ceremonies combining physical and virtual attendance to maintain family connections despite travel limitations.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave [us](american-wedding-traditions.html) such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come.

I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from [Scotland](scottish-wedding-traditions.html) and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
