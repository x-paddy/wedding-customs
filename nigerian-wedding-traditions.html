            <h2 class="accordion">Pre-[Wedding Traditions](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-traditions-around-the-world): Ikok Ibo, Sadaki, and Aso-Ebi</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Knocking on the Door (Family Introduction)</h3>
                <p><strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ikok-ibo-63"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/IG-NG_ikok_ibo.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Ikok ibo - click to hear pronunciation" lang="IG"><strong class="term-text">Ikok ibo</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ee-KOK ee-BOH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> is a formal proposal ceremony where the groom&rsquo;s family visits the bride&rsquo;s home to express matrimonial intentions, typically occurring 6-<time datetime="P12M">12 months before</time> the wedding and involving 20-50 immediate family members. This 2-4 hour gathering costs ₦100,000-₦300,000 ($65-$200 USD) and includes presenting kola nuts and palm wine while discussing compatibility between families. The tradition, essential across all Nigerian ethnic groups, sets the foundation for bride price negotiations and <a href="https://www.brides.com/wedding-traditions-4691762">wedding planning</a>.</p>
                <p>Regional variations include Yoruba families adding formal letters to the process, while Hausa families incorporate Islamic prayers during the introduction. Modern adaptations since 2020 show 40% of diaspora couples conducting hybrid introductions via Zoom, maintaining cultural authenticity while accommodating international participants.</p>
                <h3>Hausa Dowry Payment (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sadaki-1063"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HA-NG_sadaki.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Sadaki - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HA"><strong class="term-text">Sadaki</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sah-DAH-kee</span></span></span></dfn>)</h3>
                <p><strong>Sadaki</strong> is a mandatory Islamic dowry payment in Hausa Muslim tradition where the groom presents cash or livestock to the bride&rsquo;s family, occurring months before the wedding and symbolizing his financial responsibility. This 1-2 day negotiation involves 50-150 family elders (predominantly male) and costs ₦50,000-₦500,000 ($33-$330 USD) plus additional gifts like cows. The ceremony precedes the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nikkah-1497"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-NG_nikkah.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Nikkah - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Nikkah</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nee-KAH</span></span></span></dfn> and includes Quranic recitations, with women celebrating separately through henna application.</p>
                <p>Northern urban Hausas increasingly opt for cash payments over livestock, while rural communities maintain traditional cattle presentations. Recent economic pressures have led 50% of young couples to limit sadaki to symbolic amounts, though it remains a crucial status marker in Hausa society.</p>
                <h3><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-aso-ebi-1907"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/YO-NG_aso_ebi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Aso-Ebi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="YO"><strong class="term-text">Aso-Ebi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ah-SHAW eh-BEE</span></span></span></dfn> Fabric Coordination</h3>
                <p><strong>Aso-ebi</strong> is a Yoruba-originated tradition of coordinating uniform fabrics among wedding guests, distributed 3-<time datetime="P6M">6 months before</time> the ceremony to symbolize unity and group identity. Each fabric group costs ₦50,000-₦200,000 ($33-$130 USD), with different patterns distinguishing the bride&rsquo;s family, groom&rsquo;s family, and friend groups. Originally exclusive to Yoruba weddings, this practice now appears in 90% of Nigerian weddings regardless of ethnicity.</p>
                <p>Modern aso-ebi distribution utilizes online platforms for sales and customization, with Instagram vendors dominating the market. Igbo weddings adapt this tradition using George wrappers instead of lace, while Hausa celebrations incorporate more modest designs respecting Islamic dress codes.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Igbo Wine-Carrying Ceremony (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-igba-nkwu-33"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/IG-NG_igba_nkwu.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Igba Nkwu - click to hear pronunciation" lang="IG"><strong class="term-text">Igba Nkwu</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">EEG-bah nn-KWOO</span></span></span></dfn>)</h3>
                <p><strong>Igba Nkwu</strong> is the central Igbo wedding tradition where the bride searches among 200-400 guests to offer palm wine to her groom, symbolizing her acceptance of the marriage proposal. This 4-6 hour ceremony occurs at the bride&rsquo;s family home or village hall, costing ₦500,000-₦2,000,000 ($330-$1,300 USD) and featuring the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-umunna-393"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/IG-NG_umunna.mp3" data-definition="kinsmen" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="umunna - click to hear pronunciation" lang="IG"><strong class="term-text">umunna</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">oo-MOON-nah</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-umunna-393" class="definition-inline">kinsmen</span></dfn> blessing the union with kola nuts.

                <p>Urban Igbo ceremonies typically run shorter with professional emcees, while rural versions incorporate extended village dances and community participation. Christian Igbo families (representing the majority) add Bible readings to the traditional rituals, and 60% of urban couples now include DJ services playing Afrobeats alongside highlife music.</p>
                <h3>Yoruba Engagement Ceremony (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-idana-961"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/YO-NG_idana.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Idana - click to hear pronunciation" lang="YO"><strong class="term-text">Idana</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ee-DAH-nah</span></span></span></dfn>)</h3>

This 3-5 hour event occurs 1-2 days before the main wedding, involves 150-300 participants, and costs ₦300,000-₦1,500,000 ($200-$1,000 USD). Required gifts include yams (symbolizing provision), honey (sweetness in marriage), and bitter kola (longevity), presented while the couple kneels for parental blessings.</p>
                <p>Southwestern Yoruba communities emphasize elaborate dances and chants, while Muslim Yorubas incorporate Islamic prayers into the <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dobale-1642"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/YO-NG_dobale.mp3" data-definition="prostration" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dobale - click to hear pronunciation" lang="YO"><strong class="term-text">dobale</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">doh-BAH-leh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-dobale-1642" class="definition-inline">prostration</span></dfn> rituals. Post-COVID adaptations show 70% of couples hiring professional event planners who use LED screens for family presentations, modernizing the traditional call-and-response format.</p>
                <h3>Hausa Muslim Wedding (<dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nikkah-1880"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-NG_nikkah.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Nikkah - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">Nikkah</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nee-KAH</span></span></span></dfn>)</h3>
                <p><strong>Nikkah</strong> is the Islamic marriage ceremony in Hausa tradition where couples exchange vows before witnesses in a mosque or family home, typically lasting 1-2 hours with 100-200 attendees. This morning ceremony costs ₦200,000-₦800,000 ($130-$530 USD) and emphasizes consent, simplicity, and religious devotion, followed by a <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-walima-2233"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-NG_walima.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="walima - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">walima</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">wah-LEE-mah</span></span></span></dfn> feast. The event blends Arabic Islamic requirements with Hausa customs, though the controversial <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sharo-2337"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HA-NG_sharo.mp3" data-definition="flogging ritual" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sharo - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HA"><strong class="term-text">sharo</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SHAH-roh</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-sharo-2337" class="definition-inline">flogging ritual</span></dfn> has largely disappeared from modern celebrations.</p>
                <p>Urban Nikkah ceremonies increasingly include women-led segments and receptions, while rural areas maintain stricter gender separation. Live streaming has become standard, allowing diaspora family members to witness the religious vows despite distance.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in [Las Vegas](las-vegas-wedding-traditions.html), don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave [us](american-wedding-traditions.html) such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from [Scotland](scottish-wedding-traditions.html) and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
