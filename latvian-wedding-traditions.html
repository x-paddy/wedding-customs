                <p><strong>Bildinājums</strong> (lv_bildinājums) <strong>is the traditional Latvian matchmaking process that historically involved professional matchmakers arranging marriages between families, particularly common in Latgale region until the 1950s</strong>. This centuries-old practice required the groom to formally ask the bride&rsquo;s father for permission, with refusal meaning the couple would forgo any dowry or parental assistance worth €2,000-10,000 in today&rsquo;s currency.</p>
                <p><strong>Regional matchmaking variations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Latgale region</strong> (30% of weddings): Most formal approach with professional matchmakers</li>
                <li><strong>Kurzeme region</strong> (15% of weddings): Less structured, family-friend introductions</li>
                <li><strong>Vidzeme region</strong> (25% of weddings): Community-based matchmaking</li>
                <li><strong>Zemgale region</strong> (20% of weddings): Blend of formal and informal approaches</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Modern practice</strong>: While professional matchmakers are rare today, 78% of Latvian grooms still ask for paternal permission before proposing, maintaining this cultural connection. The tradition includes throwing coins into the first glass offered to the bride during the meeting, symbolizing prosperity for the future union.</p>
                <h3>Engagement Traditions: Mutual Gift Exchange</h3>
                <p><strong>Latvian engagement traditions</strong> involve both partners exchanging meaningful gifts rather than just the bride receiving a ring, reflecting Latvia&rsquo;s cultural emphasis on equality and partnership. Traditional engagement gifts range from handcrafted items (€50-200) to modern jewelry (€500-3,000), with couples often planting a tree together to symbolize their growing relationship.</p>
                <p><strong>Traditional engagement gifts by region:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Rural areas</strong>: Handwoven silk scarves, wooden utensils, embroidered linens</li>
                <li><strong>Urban centers</strong>: Modern jewelry, watches, designer accessories</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal regions</strong>: Amber jewelry, sea-themed crafts</li>
                <li><strong>Forest regions</strong>: Carved wooden items, nature-inspired pieces</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Baltic engagements traditionally last only 6 months, meaning wedding planning begins immediately after the proposal. This short engagement period dates back to agricultural societies where weddings were planned around harvest seasons.</p>

This requirement, established during the Soviet era but maintained after Latvia&rsquo;s 1991 independence, involves a formal 15-20 minute ceremony with close family and official witnesses called <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ved-ji-1263"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_vedēji.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="vedēji - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">vedēji</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-DEH-yi</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lv_vedēji).</p>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Location</strong>: State registry offices in 119 municipalities</li>
                <li><strong>Required documents</strong>: Passports, birth certificates, single status proof</li>
                <li><strong>Witnesses</strong>: Minimum 2 vedēji required</li>
                <li><strong>Language options</strong>: Latvian, Russian, or English with translator</li>
                <li><strong>Timing</strong>: Often held days or weeks before the main celebration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern couples increasingly separate their civil ceremony from their cultural celebration, with 65% choosing different dates for legal and festive ceremonies. Urban registries in Riga offer special ceremonial halls for €150-300, while rural offices typically charge standard fees.</p>
                <h3>Religious Wedding Ceremonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Religious ceremonies in Latvia</strong> follow the mandatory civil ceremony and reflect the country&rsquo;s diverse spiritual landscape, with Lutheran (36%), Catholic (25%), Orthodox (9%), and revived pagan ceremonies (5%) being most common. These ceremonies, which experienced a significant revival after 1991 independence, cost between €200-1,000 depending on the venue and denomination.</p>
                <p><strong>Regional religious preferences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Kurzeme region</strong>: 70% Lutheran ceremonies</li>
                <li><strong>Latgale region</strong>: 80% Catholic ceremonies  </li>
                <li><strong>Riga area</strong>: Mixed denominations, 15% interfaith ceremonies</li>
                <li><strong>Rural areas</strong>: 10% pagan/folk ceremony revivals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The average religious ceremony lasts 45-90 minutes and includes traditional hymns, readings in Latvian or regional languages, and blessing rituals specific to each faith. Neo-pagan ceremonies, incorporating pre-Christian Baltic traditions, have grown 300% since 2015 among couples seeking authentic cultural connections.</p>

                <p><strong>Vedēji</strong> (lv_vedēji) <strong>are married couples who serve as official witnesses, spiritual guides, and lifelong mentors to newlyweds in Latvian wedding tradition, replacing the Western concept of bridesmaids and groomsmen</strong>. This centuries-old tradition requires vedēji to sign legal documents, guide wedding rituals, prevent bride stealing, and maintain an active role in the couple&rsquo;s marriage for years afterward.</p>
                <p><strong>Vedēji responsibilities include:</strong></p>

                <li><strong>Financial support</strong>: Traditional gift of €500-2,000 to newlyweds</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Selection criteria</strong>: Couples typically choose vedēji who have been married 5+ years and demonstrate qualities they wish to emulate. Unlike temporary wedding party roles, vedēji maintain lifelong connections with the couple, similar to godparents in child baptisms. This tradition remains fundamental in 92% of Latvian weddings, even among couples incorporating Western elements.</p>

                <p><strong>La Cortège</strong> (lv_gājienu) <strong>is the traditional Latvian wedding procession that historically moved from the bride&rsquo;s family home to the ceremony location, led by musicians and involving the entire community</strong>. This procession, documented in medieval manuscripts from the 13th century, symbolizes the bride&rsquo;s journey from single to married life and differs significantly from Western processional orders.</p>

                <h3>The Bride Stealing Custom</h3>
                <p><strong>Bride stealing</strong> (<strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-l-gavas-zag-ana-79"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_līgavas_zagšana.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="līgavas zagšana - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">līgavas zagšana</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">LEE-gah-vahs ZAHG-shah-nah</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, lv_līgavas-zagšana) <strong>is a playful Latvian wedding tradition where friends &ldquo;kidnap&rdquo; the bride during the reception if the groom isn&rsquo;t vigilant, requiring him to complete embarrassing tasks or pay a ransom to retrieve her</strong>. This lighthearted custom, practiced at 60% of Latvian weddings, evolved from historical inter-village bride raids into entertainment that tests the groom&rsquo;s dedication.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical stealing scenarios:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>During dancing</strong>: Friends distract groom, whisk bride away (2-5 minutes)</li>
                <li><strong>Bathroom breaks</strong>: Accomplices &ldquo;help&rdquo; bride disappear</li>
                <li><strong>Photo sessions</strong>: Bride vanishes during group photo chaos</li>
                <li><strong>Ransom demands</strong>: €50-200 in drinks, candy, or small gifts</li>
                <li><strong>Performance tasks</strong>: Sing love songs, do 50 pushups, tell embarrassing stories</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike German traditions where brides are taken to distant pubs, Latvian bride stealing keeps the bride nearby (within 50-100 meters) with ransoms decided quickly. The <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ved-ji-1227"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_vedēji.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="vedēji - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">vedēji</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-DEH-yi</span></span></span></dfn> traditionally help prevent stealing, creating entertaining cat-and-mouse dynamics throughout the reception. Modern couples sometimes pre-arrange &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; for guaranteed entertainment value.</p>
                <h3>The Seven Bridges Tradition</h3>
                <p><strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-septi-i-tilti-1490"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_septiņi_tilti.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Septiņi tilti - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">Septiņi tilti</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">sep-TEE-nyee TIL-tee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lv_septiņi-tilti) <strong>is a Latvian wedding tradition where newlyweds visit seven different bridges after their ceremony, with each crossing representing a year of good luck or different aspects of married life</strong>. This ancient custom, rooted in beliefs about transitions and thresholds, costs €50-150 in transportation and remains popular for 40% of couples, especially in Riga where 43 bridges provide ample options.</p>
                <p><strong>Bridge symbolism and rituals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>First bridge</strong>: Health and vitality</li>
                <li><strong>Second bridge</strong>: Wealth and prosperity  </li>
                <li><strong>Third bridge</strong>: Fertility and children</li>
                <li><strong>Fourth bridge</strong>: Fidelity and trust</li>
                <li><strong>Fifth bridge</strong>: Happiness and joy</li>
                <li><strong>Sixth bridge</strong>: Longevity together</li>
                <li><strong>Seventh bridge</strong>: Eternal love</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Couples make wishes, exchange promises, or leave symbolic tokens (flowers, ribbons, coins) at each bridge. Traditional practice requires the groom to carry his bride across, though modern couples often walk hand-in-hand. Urban couples combine this with wedding photography (additional €200-500), while rural celebrations might use symbolic miniature bridges when seven actual bridges aren&rsquo;t accessible.</p>

These rituals, present in 45% of traditional weddings and costing €100-300 to implement, connect modern couples to centuries of Baltic fire worship traditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Fire ritual components:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Popular lock locations in Latvia:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <p>Couples often personalize locks with engraving (€20-40), dates, or decorative elements. The key disposal varies by location - river bridges see keys thrown into water, while inland venues might bury keys or place them in time capsules.

                <h3>2025 Latvian Wedding Trends</h3>
                <p><strong>Contemporary Latvian weddings in 2025</strong> blend ancestral traditions with modern preferences, creating celebrations that average €12,000-20,000 for 80-120 guests while selectively incorporating customs that resonate with each couple&rsquo;s values. The trend toward &ldquo;heritage personalization&rdquo; sees 78% of couples including at least three traditional elements while adapting them for contemporary sensibilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Popular tradition adaptations:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <li><strong>Digital Three Gates</strong>: QR code challenges for tech-savvy couples</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-fire rituals</strong>: LED flames or unity candles replacing bonfires</li>
                <li><strong>Heritage fusion</strong>: Mixing Latvian with partner&rsquo;s cultural traditions</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable flowers</strong>: Local, seasonal blooms only (30% cost reduction)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Emerging venue trends:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Restored manor houses</strong>: €2,000-5,000 rental (40% of weddings)</li>
                <li><strong>Forest clearings</strong>: €500-1,500 permits (15% increase since 2020)</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial spaces</strong>: €1,500-3,000 (popular in Riga)</li>
                <li><strong>Coastal locations</strong>: €1,000-3,000 (summer only)</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-day retreats</strong>: €5,000-15,000 for exclusive use</li>
                </ul>
                <p>International influences appear in 45% of Latvian weddings, particularly among couples where one partner is foreign. These celebrations creatively blend traditions - perhaps incorporating Mičošana into a destination wedding or adapting the Seven Bridges tradition to a beach setting. Young urban couples increasingly choose intimate gatherings (50-70 guests) over traditional large celebrations, allocating more budget per guest for enhanced experiences.</p>
                <h3>Alternative Celebration Options</h3>
                <p><strong>Non-traditional Latvian wedding options</strong> include destination weddings, with surprising popularity for Las Vegas ceremonies among Latvian couples seeking unique experiences at costs from $159-5,000 USD. These alternatives attract 5% of Latvian couples who want memorable celebrations without extensive traditional planning, though most incorporate some Latvian elements even abroad.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative celebration styles:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Elopement + party</strong>: Private ceremony, later reception (€3,000-8,000)</li>

                <li><strong>Adventure weddings</strong>: Hiking, sailing, or ski ceremonies (€5,000-12,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural venue weddings</strong>: Museums, theaters, libraries (€2,000-6,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual hybrid</strong>: Streaming for distant relatives (€500-1,500 tech costs)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even alternative celebrations typically maintain core traditions like <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ved-ji-3001"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_vedēji.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="vedēji - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">vedēji</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-DEH-yi</span></span></span></dfn> witnesses and some form of Mičošana ceremony. Couples choosing Vegas weddings often host traditional Latvian receptions upon return, satisfying both adventure desires and family expectations. The key trend is flexibility - modern Latvian couples feel empowered to honor traditions in ways that authentically represent their relationships while respecting cultural heritage.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a traditional Latvian wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>A traditional Latvian wedding costs between €8,000-20,000 for 80-150 guests, with regional variations: rural weddings average €8,000-12,000 while Riga celebrations reach €15,000-25,000. Major expenses include venue rental (€1,500-5,000), catering at €40-80 per guest, photography (€1,000-3,000), and traditional elements like musician-led processions (€500-1,500) and ceremonial items for <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mi-o-ana-451"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_mičošana.mp3" data-definition="€200-500" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Mičošana - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">Mičošana</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">MEE-cho-shah-nah</span></span></span><span id="def-desc-mi-o-ana-451" class="definition-inline">€200-500</span></dfn>.</p>
                <h3>What is the most important tradition in Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p><strong>Mičošana</strong> is considered the most significant Latvian wedding tradition, occurring at midnight when the bride&rsquo;s veil is replaced with a married woman&rsquo;s cap and apron. This pre-Christian ritual, practiced at 89% of traditional weddings, historically marked the point of no return - tradition states marriages could be cancelled after church ceremonies but never after Mičošana, emphasizing its binding cultural importance.</p>
                <h3>Do Latvian weddings have bridesmaids and groomsmen?</h3>
                <p>No, Latvian weddings traditionally have <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ved-ji-1111"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_vedēji.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="vedēji - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">vedēji</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">veh-DEH-yi</span></span></span></dfn></strong> instead of bridesmaids and groomsmen. Vedēji are married couples who serve as official witnesses, spiritual guides, and lifelong mentors to the newlyweds. They sign legal documents, guide wedding rituals, prevent bride stealing, and maintain an active mentorship role throughout the marriage, making their commitment much deeper than typical wedding party roles.</p>
                <h3>How long do Latvian weddings typically last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Latvian weddings last 1-3 days, with the main celebration extending from afternoon (2-3 PM) through dawn (5-6 AM). Historical weddings lasted up to 4 days, but modern celebrations typically include: pre-wedding gatherings, wedding day ceremonies and reception (12-15 hours), and next-morning brunch traditions. Urban weddings tend toward single-day events while rural celebrations more often extend multiple days.</p>
                <h3>What should guests bring to a Latvian wedding?</h3>
                <p>Guests traditionally bring flowers for the newlyweds (budget €15-30), with all attendees participating in this flower exchange tradition. Cash gifts in decorated envelopes are standard (€50-200 depending on relationship), often given during special dances. Avoid bringing knives, handkerchiefs, or clocks as gifts due to superstitions. Guests should prepare for extended celebrations and possible participation in traditions like the Three Gates ceremony.</p>
                <h3>Can foreigners have a traditional Latvian wedding?</h3>
                <p>Yes, foreigners can absolutely have traditional Latvian weddings, though the mandatory civil ceremony requires specific documentation including apostilled birth certificates and single status proof. Mixed-culture couples often blend Latvian traditions with their own heritage - 45% of international couples in Latvia incorporate elements like Mičošana, vedēji, and Three Gates while adapting others to honor both cultures.</p>
                <h3>What happens during the Three Gates ceremony?</h3>
                <p>During <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tr-s-v-rti-3063"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_trīs_vārti.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Trīs vārti - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">Trīs vārti</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">trees VAR-tee</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, guests create three symbolic gates using ribbons or flowers, stopping newlyweds who must complete challenges together. Each gate represents life stages (childhood, youth, adulthood) with tasks like sharing embarrassing stories, dancing traditional <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-polka-3340"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_polka.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="polka - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">polka</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">POL-kah</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, or demonstrating household skills. This teamwork-testing tradition appears in 75% of traditional weddings and provides entertainment while symbolizing the couple&rsquo;s ability to overcome obstacles together.</p>
                <h3>Are religious ceremonies required for Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>No, only a civil ceremony is legally required in Latvia. However, 70% of couples choose additional religious or symbolic ceremonies following their civil marriage. Popular options include Lutheran (36%), Catholic (25%), Orthodox (9%), or revived pagan ceremonies (5%). The civil ceremony costs €14-70 while religious ceremonies add €200-1,000 depending on the venue and denomination.</p>
                <h3>What traditional foods are served at Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Latvian wedding feasts feature hearty dishes including <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-c-kas-cepetis-4156"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_cūkas_cepetis.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="cūkas cepetis - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">cūkas cepetis</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">TSOO-kahs TSE-peh-tis</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (roast pork, €8-12/serving), <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-p-r-gi-4216"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_pīrāgi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="pīrāgi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">pīrāgi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">pee-RAH-gee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (bacon rolls, €1 each), <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-rupjmaize-4264"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_rupjmaize.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="rupjmaize - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">rupjmaize</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ROOP-my-zeh</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (dark rye bread), and <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sk-be-u-zupa-4313"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/LV-LV_skābeņu_zupa.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="skābeņu zupa - click to hear pronunciation" lang="LV"><strong class="term-text">skābeņu zupa</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SKAH-beh-nyoo ZOO-pah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (sorrel soup).

Wedding feasts serve 15-20 different dishes with costs averaging €40-80 per guest for traditional menus.</p>
                <h3>When is wedding season in Latvia?</h3>
                <p>Latvian wedding season runs from May through September, with 65% of weddings occurring June-August when weather permits outdoor celebrations and traditional elements like Seven Bridges walks. Winter weddings (December-February) represent only 10% of celebrations due to weather constraints. May and September offer lower venue costs (20-30% discount) while maintaining reasonable weather for outdoor traditions. Historical agricultural calendars avoided harvest time (late August-September), though modern couples face fewer such restrictions.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️

            <h2 class="accordion">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>How much does a traditional Latvian wedding cost?</h3>
                <p>Great question—and the answer might surprise you with its range. Traditional Latvian weddings cost between €8,000-20,000 ($8,800-$22,000 USD) for 80-150 guests, but location makes a huge difference. Rural weddings average €8,000-12,000 ($8,800-$13,200 USD) while Riga celebrations climb to €15,000-25,000 ($16,500-$27,500 USD), primarily due to venue costs.

Here&#x27;s what actually drives the budget: venue rental (€1,500-5,000 / $1,650-$5,500 USD), catering at €40-80 ($44-$88 USD) per guest for those marathon feasts, and photography (€1,000-3,000 / $1,100-$3,300 USD) because you need someone who understands how to capture Mičošana properly. Traditional elements add surprising costs—musician-led processions run €500-1,500 ($550-$1,650 USD) while ceremonial items for midnight traditions cost €200-500 ($220-$550 USD).

💡 Pro Tip: Many couples save 30% by choosing May or September over peak summer months, and rural venues often include multiple celebration spaces in their base price.</p>
                <h3>What is the Mičošana ceremony in Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Mičošana is a midnight ritual where the bride&#x27;s veil is replaced with a married woman&#x27;s cap and the groom receives a traditional hat, symbolizing their transition to married life.</p>
                <h3>What is the most important tradition in Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Without question, **Mičošana** reigns supreme as the most significant Latvian wedding tradition. This midnight capping ceremony, where the bride&#x27;s veil is replaced with a married woman&#x27;s cap and apron, appears in 89% of traditional weddings and carries more cultural weight than any other ritual.

Why does this particular tradition matter so much? History holds the answer. Traditional law stated that marriages could be cancelled after church ceremonies, broken after festivities began, but never—absolutely never—after Mičošana. This pre-Christian ritual marks the irreversible transformation from child to adult, from individual to spouse. The emotional weight is staggering; photographers report more tears during these 45 minutes than all other wedding moments combined. Even ultramodern couples who skip other traditions insist on authentic Mičošana ceremonies.</p>
                <h3>Are civil ceremonies required for Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Yes, civil ceremonies (€14-70) are legally required before any religious or symbolic celebration can take place in Latvia.</p>
                <h3>Do Latvian weddings have bridesmaids and groomsmen?</h3>
                <p>No, and the alternative is so much better! Instead of temporary wedding party members, Latvian couples choose **vedēji**—married couples who become lifelong mentors and spiritual guardians of the marriage. Think of them as combination witnesses, marriage counselors, and fairy godparents rolled into experienced, married packages.

Vedēji responsibilities extend far beyond holding bouquets or planning bachelor parties. They sign legal documents, guide couples through traditional ceremonies, prevent bride stealing during receptions (yes, really), and most importantly, maintain active roles throughout the marriage. Forgetting anniversary calls from your vedēji is social catastrophe. They traditionally gift €500-2,000 ($550-$2,200 USD) to newlyweds and provide ongoing support during rough patches. The selection process is serious business—couples typically choose vedēji married 5+ years who exemplify relationship goals.</p>
                <h3>What role do Vedēji play in Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Vedēji are married couples who serve as witnesses, guides, and lifelong mentors to the newlyweds, replacing the traditional concept of bridesmaids and groomsmen.</p>
                <h3>How long do Latvian weddings typically last?</h3>
                <p>Buckle up for marathon celebrations! Traditional Latvian weddings last 1-3 days, with the main event extending from afternoon (2-3 PM) until dawn (5-6 AM). That&#x27;s 12-15 hours of active celebration, not counting pre-wedding gatherings and next-morning recovery brunches.

Historical agricultural weddings stretched even longer—up to 4 days when travel meant horse-drawn carriages and guests came from distant villages. Modern urban weddings tend toward intense single-day events, while rural celebrations still embrace multi-day formats. The timeline typically includes: Friday evening gatherings, Saturday ceremonies and reception, and Sunday recovery brunch featuring the magical solyanka soup. Even &quot;short&quot; contemporary weddings rarely end before 2 AM, especially if Mičošana happens at midnight. Smart guests book accommodations and clear Sunday schedules.</p>
                <h3>What is the Three Gates (Trīs vārti) ceremony?</h3>
                <p>The Three Gates ceremony involves newlyweds passing through three symbolic gates, completing challenges that test their teamwork and readiness for marriage.</p>
                <h3>What should guests bring to a Latvian wedding?</h3>
                <p>Flowers. Seriously, bring flowers. This isn&#x27;t optional—it&#x27;s fundamental to Latvian wedding culture where flower exchanges create connections between all participants. Budget €15-30 ($17-$33 USD) for a proper bouquet, avoiding funeral-associated chrysanthemums or odd-numbered roses.

Cash gifts in decorated envelopes are standard, ranging from €50-200 ($55-$220 USD) depending on your relationship to the couple. These are often presented during special dances rather than placed in card boxes. Absolutely avoid bringing knives (they &quot;cut&quot; relationships), handkerchiefs (represent tears), or clocks (symbolize time running out) due to persistent superstitions.

⚠️ Critical Warning: Prepare for marathon celebrations. Comfortable shoes for dancing, layers for temperature changes, and stamina for 12+ hour parties are essential guest preparations.</p>
                <h3>How long do traditional Latvian weddings last?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Latvian weddings are multi-day celebrations typically hosting 50-200 guests, though modern versions may be shorter.</p>
                <h3>Can foreigners have a traditional Latvian wedding?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Foreigners can have beautiful traditional Latvian weddings, though navigating requirements needs patience. The mandatory civil ceremony requires specific documentation—apostilled birth certificates, single status proof, and sometimes lengthy bureaucratic processes. Start paperwork immediately after engagement, especially if you&#x27;re from non-EU countries.

Mixed-culture couples create the most interesting celebrations. About 45% of international couples in Latvia blend traditions creatively—imagine Mičošana performed with Indian saris, or Seven Bridges ceremony adapted for Buddhist beliefs. The key is understanding which elements carry deep meaning versus those open to interpretation. Most Latvian families are thrilled when foreign partners embrace local traditions, seeing it as respect for cultural heritage. One British groom learned traditional folk dances to surprise his bride&#x27;s grandmother—the video went viral in Latvia.</p>
                <h3>What is the significance of the bride stealing tradition?</h3>
                <p>Līgavas zagšana (bride stealing) is a playful tradition where guests &#x27;kidnap&#x27; the bride, requiring the groom to complete tasks or pay a ransom for her return.</p>
                <h3>What happens during the Three Gates ceremony?</h3>
                <p>The Three Gates (Trīs vārti) transforms wedding receptions into interactive theater where your relationship skills get tested before hundreds of witnesses. Guests create three physical barriers using ribbons, flowers, or linked arms, and newlyweds must complete challenges proving their readiness for married life.

Each gate represents a life stage with specific challenges. First gate (childhood) might require embarrassing story exchanges or folk song performances. Second gate (youth) tests romance—create spontaneous poetry, dance traditional steps without stumbling, or answer increasingly personal relationship trivia. Third gate (adulthood) demands practical skills like threading needles together or calculating household budgets without calculators.

Regional variations keep things interesting. Coastal couples might tie maritime knots, agricultural regions test grain identification skills, while urban celebrations incorporate escape room puzzles. The genius? These challenges actually mirror marriage requirements: communication, cooperation, humor under pressure, and ability to perform while relatives shout &quot;helpful&quot; advice.</p>
                <h3>What is traditional Latvian wedding attire?</h3>
                <p>Traditional attire includes the tautastērps (folk costume), though modern couples often blend this with contemporary white wedding gowns.</p>
                <h3>Are religious ceremonies required for Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>No religious ceremony is required—only the civil ceremony at state registry offices is legally mandatory. This costs just €14-70 ($15-$77 USD) and takes 15-20 minutes with your vedēji as witnesses. However, 70% of couples choose additional religious or symbolic ceremonies to add spiritual weight to their legal union.

The religious landscape offers diverse options: Lutheran services (36% of religious ceremonies) feature Bach and last 45 minutes, Catholic ceremonies (25%) extend to full mass, Orthodox celebrations (9%) dazzle with incense and crowning rituals, while neo-pagan ceremonies (5% but growing 300% since 2015) involve forest settings and fire rituals. Religious ceremonies add €200-1,000 ($220-$1,100 USD) to budgets depending on venue and requirements. Urban couples increasingly blend denominations—one memorable wedding featured Buddhist meditation, Lutheran hymns, and pagan fire jumping.</p>
                <h3>What happens during the morning-after celebrations?</h3>
                <p>The morning after features solyanka soup, gift opening, and continued celebrations with close family and friends.</p>
                <h3>What traditional foods are served at Latvian weddings?</h3>
                <p>Prepare your stomach for marathon feasting! Latvian wedding meals feature 15-20 different dishes served over 6-10 hours, costing €40-80 ($44-$88 USD) per guest. This isn&#x27;t dinner—it&#x27;s endurance eating celebrating agricultural abundance.

Essential dishes include cūkas cepetis (roast pork, €8-12 / $9-$13 USD per serving), the mandatory pīrāgi (bacon rolls, €1 each with 3-5 per guest minimum), rupjmaize (dark rye bread in unlimited quantities), and seasonal specialties like skābeņu zupa (sorrel soup) for summer weddings. The morning after features solyanka soup (€8-12 / $9-$13 USD)—a hangover cure combining 5-7 cured meats with pickles and sour cream that actually works.

Modern adaptations accommodate dietary restrictions creatively. Vegetarian options appear at 60% of weddings, gluten-free versions of traditional breads exist (though grandmothers disapprove), and one memorable vegan wedding recreated every meat dish with mushrooms. The feast&#x27;s true purpose transcends food—extended dining creates bonding opportunities that fast-food culture eliminated.</p>
                <h3>What is the Pūrs tradition?</h3>
                <p>Pūrs is the traditional bridal dower consisting of handmade textiles and household items, symbolizing the bride&#x27;s preparation for married life.</p>
                <h3>When is wedding season in Latvia?</h3>
                <p>Latvian wedding season peaks June through August, when 65% of ceremonies take advantage of white nights and outdoor tradition possibilities. May through September represents the extended season, with weather permitting outdoor processions, Seven Bridges walks, and forest ceremonies. Winter weddings (December-February) account for only 10% of celebrations—icy conditions complicate transportation and outdoor traditions.

May and September offer strategic advantages: venue discounts (20-30% off peak prices), moderate weather for outdoor elements, and fewer competing events. Historical agricultural calendars avoided late August-September harvest times, though modern couples face fewer such restrictions. Midsummer (Jāņi) weddings gain popularity for ready-made festive atmosphere, while Christmas market settings create magical winter alternatives.

💰 Budget Alert: July Saturdays book 18 months ahead at premium prices. September Fridays offer 40% savings with nearly identical weather odds.

Smart couples consider tradition requirements when selecting dates. Outdoor Seven Bridges ceremony? Skip January. Planning elaborate flower arrangements? June&#x27;s local blooms cost 50% less than February imports. Want natural decorations? October&#x27;s fall colors are free. The key is balancing tradition possibilities with practical considerations—and grandmother&#x27;s strong opinions about &quot;proper&quot; wedding seasons.</p>
                <h3>How are modern couples adapting Latvian wedding traditions?</h3>
                <p>Modern couples often blend traditional elements with international influences, choosing which customs to maintain while adding contemporary touches.</p>

<script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question", "name": "How much does a traditional Latvian wedding cost?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Great question—and the answer might surprise you with its range. Traditional Latvian weddings cost between €8,000-20,000 ($8,800-$22,000 USD) for 80-150 guests, but location makes a huge difference. Rural weddings average €8,000-12,000 ($8,800-$13,200 USD) while Riga celebrations climb to €15,000-25,000 ($16,500-$27,500 USD), primarily due to venue costs.\n\nHere's what actually drives the budget: venue rental (€1,500-5,000 / $1,650-$5,500 USD), catering at €40-80 ($44-$88 USD) per guest for those marathon feasts, and photography (€1,000-3,000 / $1,100-$3,300 USD) because you need someone who understands how to capture Mičošana properly. Traditional elements add surprising costs—musician-led processions run €500-1,500 ($550-$1,650 USD) while ceremonial items for midnight traditions cost €200-500 ($220-$550 USD).\n\n💡 Pro Tip: Many couples save 30% by choosing May or September over peak summer months, and rural venues often include multiple celebration spaces in their base price."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Mičošana ceremony in Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Mičošana is a midnight ritual where the bride's veil is replaced with a married woman's cap and the groom receives a traditional hat, symbolizing their transition to married life."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the most important tradition in Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Without question, **Mičošana** reigns supreme as the most significant Latvian wedding tradition. This midnight capping ceremony, where the bride's veil is replaced with a married woman's cap and apron, appears in 89% of traditional weddings and carries more cultural weight than any other ritual.\n\nWhy does this particular tradition matter so much? History holds the answer. Traditional law stated that marriages could be cancelled after church ceremonies, broken after festivities began, but never—absolutely never—after Mičošana. This pre-Christian ritual marks the irreversible transformation from child to adult, from individual to spouse. The emotional weight is staggering; photographers report more tears during these 45 minutes than all other wedding moments combined. Even ultramodern couples who skip other traditions insist on authentic Mičošana ceremonies."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are civil ceremonies required for Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, civil ceremonies (€14-70) are legally required before any religious or symbolic celebration can take place in Latvia."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Latvian weddings have bridesmaids and groomsmen?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No, and the alternative is so much better! Instead of temporary wedding party members, Latvian couples choose **vedēji**—married couples who become lifelong mentors and spiritual guardians of the marriage. Think of them as combination witnesses, marriage counselors, and fairy godparents rolled into experienced, married packages.\n\nVedēji responsibilities extend far beyond holding bouquets or planning bachelor parties. They sign legal documents, guide couples through traditional ceremonies, prevent bride stealing during receptions (yes, really), and most importantly, maintain active roles throughout the marriage. Forgetting anniversary calls from your vedēji is social catastrophe. They traditionally gift €500-2,000 ($550-$2,200 USD) to newlyweds and provide ongoing support during rough patches. The selection process is serious business—couples typically choose vedēji married 5+ years who exemplify relationship goals."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What role do Vedēji play in Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Vedēji are married couples who serve as witnesses, guides, and lifelong mentors to the newlyweds, replacing the traditional concept of bridesmaids and groomsmen."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do Latvian weddings typically last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Buckle up for marathon celebrations! Traditional Latvian weddings last 1-3 days, with the main event extending from afternoon (2-3 PM) until dawn (5-6 AM). That's 12-15 hours of active celebration, not counting pre-wedding gatherings and next-morning recovery brunches.\n\nHistorical agricultural weddings stretched even longer—up to 4 days when travel meant horse-drawn carriages and guests came from distant villages. Modern urban weddings tend toward intense single-day events, while rural celebrations still embrace multi-day formats. The timeline typically includes: Friday evening gatherings, Saturday ceremonies and reception, and Sunday recovery brunch featuring the magical solyanka soup. Even \"short\" contemporary weddings rarely end before 2 AM, especially if Mičošana happens at midnight. Smart guests book accommodations and clear Sunday schedules."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Three Gates (Trīs vārti) ceremony?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Three Gates ceremony involves newlyweds passing through three symbolic gates, completing challenges that test their teamwork and readiness for marriage."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What should guests bring to a Latvian wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Flowers. Seriously, bring flowers. This isn't optional—it's fundamental to Latvian wedding culture where flower exchanges create connections between all participants. Budget €15-30 ($17-$33 USD) for a proper bouquet, avoiding funeral-associated chrysanthemums or odd-numbered roses.\n\nCash gifts in decorated envelopes are standard, ranging from €50-200 ($55-$220 USD) depending on your relationship to the couple. These are often presented during special dances rather than placed in card boxes. Absolutely avoid bringing knives (they \"cut\" relationships), handkerchiefs (represent tears), or clocks (symbolize time running out) due to persistent superstitions.\n\n⚠️ Critical Warning: Prepare for marathon celebrations. Comfortable shoes for dancing, layers for temperature changes, and stamina for 12+ hour parties are essential guest preparations."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do traditional Latvian weddings last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional Latvian weddings are multi-day celebrations typically hosting 50-200 guests, though modern versions may be shorter."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can foreigners have a traditional Latvian wedding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Absolutely! Foreigners can have beautiful traditional Latvian weddings, though navigating requirements needs patience. The mandatory civil ceremony requires specific documentation—apostilled birth certificates, single status proof, and sometimes lengthy bureaucratic processes. Start paperwork immediately after engagement, especially if you're from non-EU countries.\n\nMixed-culture couples create the most interesting celebrations. About 45% of international couples in Latvia blend traditions creatively—imagine Mičošana performed with Indian saris, or Seven Bridges ceremony adapted for Buddhist beliefs. The key is understanding which elements carry deep meaning versus those open to interpretation. Most Latvian families are thrilled when foreign partners embrace local traditions, seeing it as respect for cultural heritage. One British groom learned traditional folk dances to surprise his bride's grandmother—the video went viral in Latvia."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the significance of the bride stealing tradition?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Līgavas zagšana (bride stealing) is a playful tradition where guests 'kidnap' the bride, requiring the groom to complete tasks or pay a ransom for her return."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What happens during the Three Gates ceremony?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Three Gates (Trīs vārti) transforms wedding receptions into interactive theater where your relationship skills get tested before hundreds of witnesses. Guests create three physical barriers using ribbons, flowers, or linked arms, and newlyweds must complete challenges proving their readiness for married life.\n\nEach gate represents a life stage with specific challenges. First gate (childhood) might require embarrassing story exchanges or folk song performances. Second gate (youth) tests romance—create spontaneous poetry, dance traditional steps without stumbling, or answer increasingly personal relationship trivia. Third gate (adulthood) demands practical skills like threading needles together or calculating household budgets without calculators.\n\nRegional variations keep things interesting. Coastal couples might tie maritime knots, agricultural regions test grain identification skills, while urban celebrations incorporate escape room puzzles. The genius? These challenges actually mirror marriage requirements: communication, cooperation, humor under pressure, and ability to perform while relatives shout \"helpful\" advice."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is traditional Latvian wedding attire?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional attire includes the tautastērps (folk costume), though modern couples often blend this with contemporary white wedding gowns."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are religious ceremonies required for Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No religious ceremony is required—only the civil ceremony at state registry offices is legally mandatory. This costs just €14-70 ($15-$77 USD) and takes 15-20 minutes with your vedēji as witnesses. However, 70% of couples choose additional religious or symbolic ceremonies to add spiritual weight to their legal union.\n\nThe religious landscape offers diverse options: Lutheran services (36% of religious ceremonies) feature Bach and last 45 minutes, Catholic ceremonies (25%) extend to full mass, Orthodox celebrations (9%) dazzle with incense and crowning rituals, while neo-pagan ceremonies (5% but growing 300% since 2015) involve forest settings and fire rituals. Religious ceremonies add €200-1,000 ($220-$1,100 USD) to budgets depending on venue and requirements. Urban couples increasingly blend denominations—one memorable wedding featured Buddhist meditation, Lutheran hymns, and pagan fire jumping."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What happens during the morning-after celebrations?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The morning after features solyanka soup, gift opening, and continued celebrations with close family and friends."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What traditional foods are served at Latvian weddings?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Prepare your stomach for marathon feasting! Latvian wedding meals feature 15-20 different dishes served over 6-10 hours, costing €40-80 ($44-$88 USD) per guest. This isn't dinner—it's endurance eating celebrating agricultural abundance.\n\nEssential dishes include cūkas cepetis (roast pork, €8-12 / $9-$13 USD per serving), the mandatory pīrāgi (bacon rolls, €1 each with 3-5 per guest minimum), rupjmaize (dark rye bread in unlimited quantities), and seasonal specialties like skābeņu zupa (sorrel soup) for summer weddings. The morning after features solyanka soup (€8-12 / $9-$13 USD)—a hangover cure combining 5-7 cured meats with pickles and sour cream that actually works.\n\nModern adaptations accommodate dietary restrictions creatively. Vegetarian options appear at 60% of weddings, gluten-free versions of traditional breads exist (though grandmothers disapprove), and one memorable vegan wedding recreated every meat dish with mushrooms. The feast's true purpose transcends food—extended dining creates bonding opportunities that fast-food culture eliminated."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Pūrs tradition?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Pūrs is the traditional bridal dower consisting of handmade textiles and household items, symbolizing the bride's preparation for married life."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "When is wedding season in Latvia?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Latvian wedding season peaks June through August, when 65% of ceremonies take advantage of white nights and outdoor tradition possibilities. May through September represents the extended season, with weather permitting outdoor processions, Seven Bridges walks, and forest ceremonies. Winter weddings (December-February) account for only 10% of celebrations—icy conditions complicate transportation and outdoor traditions.\n\nMay and September offer strategic advantages: venue discounts (20-30% off peak prices), moderate weather for outdoor elements, and fewer competing events. Historical agricultural calendars avoided late August-September harvest times, though modern couples face fewer such restrictions. Midsummer (Jāņi) weddings gain popularity for ready-made festive atmosphere, while Christmas market settings create magical winter alternatives.\n\n💰 Budget Alert: July Saturdays book 18 months ahead at premium prices. September Fridays offer 40% savings with nearly identical weather odds.\n\nSmart couples consider tradition requirements when selecting dates. Outdoor Seven Bridges ceremony? Skip January. Planning elaborate flower arrangements? June's local blooms cost 50% less than February imports. Want natural decorations? October's fall colors are free. The key is balancing tradition possibilities with practical considerations—and grandmother's strong opinions about \"proper\" wedding seasons."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are modern couples adapting Latvian wedding traditions?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Modern couples often blend traditional elements with international influences, choosing which customs to maintain while adding contemporary touches."}}]}</script>
