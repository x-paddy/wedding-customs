                <p><strong>Tilak</strong> is a Hindu pre-wedding ceremony that formally accepts the groom into the bride&rsquo;s family, typically occurring 1-2 days before the main wedding and involving 20-50 participants at a cost of 50,000-150,000 MUR ($1,090-3,260 USD).

                <p>Regional variations exist across Mauritian Hindu communities: Telugu families organize more elaborate ceremonies with traditional games lasting up to 4 hours, while Tamil communities keep the ritual more intimate with only immediate family members. Urban Hindu families increasingly include female participants in the ceremony, departing from traditional male-only customs observed in rural areas. The Muslim equivalent, <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-roka-1540"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_roka.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Roka - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">Roka</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ROH-kah</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, focuses on gift exchanges without the tilak marking, typically involving jewelry and sweets worth 100,000-200,000 MUR.</p>

                <p><strong>Haldi</strong> is a pre-wedding purification ceremony that involves applying turmeric paste to the bride and groom for spiritual cleansing, held 1-2 days before the wedding with 50-100 participants at a cost of 100,000-300,000 MUR ($2,170-6,520 USD). Married women traditionally apply the paste to the bride using mango tree twigs, while men perform the ritual for the groom, creating a festive atmosphere with singing and blessings lasting 3-4 hours.</p>
                <p>The ceremony typically takes place in the morning at the bride&rsquo;s family home, with participants wearing yellow clothing to match the turmeric theme. The paste consists of turmeric powder mixed with rose water, sandalwood, and milk, believed to enhance the couple&rsquo;s complexion and ward off evil spirits. Following the application, families perform <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-aarti-2570"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_aarti.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="aarti - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">aarti</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">AAR-tee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lamp waving ritual) and serve a vegetarian feast on banana leaves, featuring traditional curries and sweets.</p>
                <p>Post-COVID adaptations have reduced participant numbers by 50% in urban areas, with 70% of couples opting for organic turmeric paste and eco-friendly decorations. Social media influence has transformed the event into a photogenic celebration, with professional photographers capturing candid moments for Instagram reels and wedding albums. Tamil Hindu communities incorporate <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kummi-3086"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/TA-MU_kummi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kummi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="TA"><strong class="term-text">kummi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">KOOM-mee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> dances during the ceremony, while Creole-influenced Hindu families add <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sega-3180"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MFE-MU_sega.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sega - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MF"><strong class="term-text">sega</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SEH-gah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> rhythms to the traditional music.</p>

                <p><strong>Mehendi</strong> is a pre-wedding beautification ceremony where intricate henna designs are applied to the bride&rsquo;s hands and feet, occurring 2-3 days before the wedding with 100-200 participants at a cost of 150,000-400,000 MUR ($3,260-8,700 USD). Professional henna artists create elaborate patterns over 4-6 hours, often incorporating the groom&rsquo;s name hidden within the design for a traditional post-wedding game where the groom must find his name.</p>
                <p>The event transforms into a musical celebration shared by both Hindu and Muslim communities in Mauritius, featuring <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-qawwali-3895"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/UR-MU_qawwali.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="qawwali - click to hear pronunciation" lang="UR"><strong class="term-text">qawwali</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">kuh-VAH-lee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances and traditional songs.

The darker the henna stains, the stronger the marriage bond is believed to be according to local tradition.</p>
                <p>Modern adaptations since 2022 include LED-lit venues and fusion henna designs incorporating glitter and crystals, with 80% of urban brides hiring artists through mobile apps. Hindu designs typically feature floral and peacock motifs, while Muslim patterns emphasize geometric shapes and Arabic calligraphy. Northern Mauritius families with Chinese heritage often request lotus flowers and dragon motifs, reflecting the island&rsquo;s multicultural blend.</p>

                <h3>Church Wedding Ceremony (Christian Sacred Vows)</h3>
                <p><strong>Church wedding ceremonies</strong> in Mauritius are Christian religious services where couples exchange vows before God and congregation, typically involving 100-200 participants at a cost of 150,000-400,000 MUR ($3,260-8,700 USD).

                <p>The ceremony requires specific elements: a complete tea set often passed through generations, cushions for kneeling, and traditional Chinese pastries. The bride wears a <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-cheongsam-2000"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ZH-MU_cheongsam.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="cheongsam - click to hear pronunciation" lang="ZH"><strong class="term-text">cheongsam</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">chung-SAM</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (traditional dress) while the groom dons a silk suit, with red decorations symbolizing prosperity.

                <h3>Sega Dance (Traditional Reception Entertainment)</h3>
                <p><strong>Sega dance</strong> is a Creole-origin performance tradition that animates wedding receptions across all ethnic groups, featuring professional performers at a cost of 50,000-150,000 MUR ($1,090-3,260 USD).

                <p>Originally developed by African slaves, sega has evolved into Mauritius&rsquo;s national dance, performed at 95% of wedding receptions regardless of religious background. The dance involves swaying hips and shuffling feet without lifting them, maintaining connection to the earth. Professional troupes perform 4-5 sets throughout the evening, alternating with modern music to accommodate all age groups.</p>
                <p>Modern adaptations include DJ remixes of traditional sega songs, used in 80% of receptions post-2020, and LED costumes for performers creating spectacular visual effects.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <h3>Urban vs Rural Wedding Differences</h3>
                <p><strong>Urban Mauritian weddings</strong> in cities like Port Louis average 2-3 days with 150-250 guests, contrasting with rural celebrations lasting 4-5 days with 300-500 participants. City weddings cost 30% more due to venue prices but save on duration, with 70% using hotels or banquet halls versus 80% of rural weddings held in decorated home marquees costing 100,000-300,000 MUR less.</p>
                <p>Digital innovations define urban ceremonies: 90% send WhatsApp invitations saving 50,000 MUR on printing, 60% hire wedding planners charging 150,000-400,000 MUR, and 100% employ professional photography with drone coverage. Rural weddings maintain traditional elements like community cooking where neighbors contribute labor, reducing catering costs by 40% while strengthening social bonds through collective preparation.</p>
                <p>Modern urban couples blend traditions across ethnic lines, with 60% of Hindu weddings incorporating <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sega-981"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MFE-MU_sega.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sega - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MF"><strong class="term-text">sega</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SEH-gah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> performances and 40% of Christian ceremonies adding <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-mehendi-1055"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_mehendi.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="mehendi - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">mehendi</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">meh-HEN-dee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> parties. Rural communities preserve distinct ethnic practices, though younger generations increasingly request fusion elements like DJ services alongside traditional musicians. Post-COVID, rural weddings adopted some urban practices including smaller guest lists and outdoor venues for safety.</p>
                <h3>Inter-ethnic Wedding Celebrations</h3>
                <p><strong>Inter-ethnic marriages</strong> represent 8% of Mauritian unions, creating unique ceremonies that blend multiple cultural traditions while respecting religious requirements. Hindu-Christian couples typically conduct civil ceremonies first (mandatory except for Muslim rites), followed by blessings in both traditions, costing 800,000-1,500,000 MUR ($17,390-32,610 USD) for dual celebrations.</p>
                <p>Muslim-Hindu unions face complex negotiations regarding <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nikah-1887"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-MU_nikah.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nikah - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">nikah</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nee-KAH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> requirements and dietary restrictions, with 70% opting for separate ceremonies on different days. Successful integration includes vegetarian options at all events, non-alcoholic receptions, and careful scheduling around religious obligations. Chinese-Creole marriages seamlessly blend <strong>tea ceremonies</strong> with <strong>sega</strong> celebrations, creating colorful fusions appreciated by both communities.</p>
                <p>Legal requirements mandate civil registration before religious ceremonies, providing neutral ground for inter-faith couples. Modern venues offer separate prayer rooms and flexible catering accommodating multiple dietary laws. Since 2022, specialized wedding planners charging 200,000-500,000 MUR emerged to navigate cultural sensitivities, ensuring both families feel respected while creating unified celebrations.</p>

                <h3>How much does a traditional Mauritius wedding cost in total?</h3>
                <p>Traditional Mauritius weddings cost between 500,000-2,000,000 MUR ($10,870-43,480 USD) in 2024, with Hindu and Muslim celebrations averaging 1,200,000 MUR due to multiple ceremonies over 3-5 days. The total includes venue rental (100,000-500,000 MUR), catering for 200-400 guests (200,000-600,000 MUR), traditional attire and jewelry (150,000-400,000 MUR), photography (100,000-300,000 MUR), entertainment (50,000-150,000 MUR), decorations (80,000-250,000 MUR), and religious ceremony fees (20,000-100,000 MUR).

                <h3>Who typically pays for different wedding expenses in Mauritius?</h3>
                <p>Traditional payment customs vary by ethnic group, with Hindu families following <strong>kanyadaan</strong> principles where the bride&rsquo;s family covers ceremony costs (300,000-500,000 MUR) while the groom&rsquo;s family handles reception expenses (200,000-400,000 MUR). Muslim traditions involve the groom providing <strong>mohaar</strong> (100,000-500,000 MUR in jewelry or property) while both families share celebration costs equally. Modern couples (60% in urban areas) contribute personally, covering 40-60% of expenses through savings and loans, with parents providing remaining support. Chinese families traditionally have groom&rsquo;s side bearing 70% of costs while receiving <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-hongbao-2698"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/ZH-MU_hongbao.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="hongbao - click to hear pronunciation" lang="ZH"><strong class="term-text">hongbao</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">hong-BAO</span></span></span></dfn></strong> gifts from guests offsetting 30-40% of expenses. Inter-ethnic marriages negotiate custom arrangements, often splitting all costs 50-50 between families regardless of tradition.</p>
                <h3>What are the main differences between Hindu Tilak and Muslim <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-roka-2961"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_roka.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="Roka - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">Roka</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">ROH-kah</span></span></span></dfn> ceremonies?</h3>
                <p><strong>Tilak</strong> ceremonies involve applying <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-kumkum-3045"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_kumkum.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="kumkum - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">kumkum</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">koom-KOOM</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (vermilion) marks on the groom&rsquo;s forehead by the bride&rsquo;s brother, symbolizing acceptance into the Hindu family, while Muslim <strong>Roka</strong> focuses on formal engagement through gift exchanges without physical markings. Tilak costs 50,000-150,000 MUR including religious items like <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-tilak-thali-3369"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_tilak_thali.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tilak thali - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">tilak thali</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">TEE-luk TAH-lee</span></span></span></dfn></strong>, fruits, and sweets, whereas Roka expenses reach 100,000-200,000 MUR primarily for jewelry gifts. Hindu ceremonies include <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-aarti-3521"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/HI-MU_aarti.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="aarti - click to hear pronunciation" lang="HI"><strong class="term-text">aarti</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">AAR-tee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (lamp waving) and mantras led by priests lasting 2-3 hours, contrasting with Muslim events featuring <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-dua-3645"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-MU_dua.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="dua - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">dua</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">DOO-ah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> (prayers) and <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nasheed-3672"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-MU_nasheed.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nasheed - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">nasheed</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nah-SHEED</span></span></span></dfn> songs for 1-2 hours. Both serve as formal acceptances preventing other marriage proposals, but Tilak emphasizes spiritual blessing through vermillion while Roka centers on material commitments through <strong>mohaar</strong> negotiations.</p>
                <h3>How do modern Mauritian couples incorporate <dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-sega-3971"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MFE-MU_sega.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="sega - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MF"><strong class="term-text">sega</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">SEH-gah</span></span></span></dfn> dance into weddings?</h3>
                <p><strong>Sega</strong> dance performances occur during wedding receptions across all ethnic groups, with 95% of Mauritian weddings featuring professional troupes costing 50,000-150,000 MUR for 2-3 hour shows. Hindu receptions blend sega with <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-bhojpuri-4254"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/BHO-MU_bhojpuri.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="bhojpuri - click to hear pronunciation" lang="BH"><strong class="term-text">bhojpuri</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">BHOJ-poo-ree</span></span></span></dfn></strong> music, creating fusion performances where traditional <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-ravanne-4334"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/MFE-MU_ravanne.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="ravanne - click to hear pronunciation" lang="MF"><strong class="term-text">ravanne</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">rah-VAHN</span></span></span></dfn></strong> drums accompany Hindi songs. Muslim weddings maintain religious guidelines by featuring sega music without mixed-gender dancing, with 60% opting for female-only dance segments. Professional performers wear LED costumes (popular since 2022) and engage guests in circular formations teaching basic steps-swaying hips while keeping feet grounded. Modern DJs charge 30,000-80,000 MUR to mix traditional sega with contemporary music, creating seamless transitions between cultural performances and party dancing that appeals to younger guests.</p>
                <h3>What documents are required for civil marriage registration in Mauritius?</h3>
                <p>Civil registration requires birth certificates, national identity cards, and single status certificates for both parties, with foreign nationals needing additional apostilled documents translated into English or French. Couples must give 10 days notice at the Civil Status Office, paying 5,000 MUR in fees, with ceremonies conducted by designated officers before religious celebrations (mandatory except for Muslim <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-nikah-5403"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-MU_nikah.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="nikah - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">nikah</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">nee-KAH</span></span></span></dfn></strong> which includes civil registration). Divorced individuals provide decree absolute certificates, widowed persons present death certificates, and inter-faith couples sign declarations regarding children&rsquo;s religious upbringing. Since 2022, digital applications reduce processing time by 50%, though physical presence remains mandatory for oath-taking. Non-citizens require residence proof or tourist visa validity exceeding 15 days. Same-sex unions remain unrecognized despite ongoing legislative discussions affecting 2% of applications.</p>
                <h3>How much do guests typically give as wedding gifts in Mauritius?</h3>
                <p>Wedding gift amounts vary by relationship and ethnic customs, with close family members giving 10,000-50,000 MUR ($217-1,087 USD) while friends and colleagues contribute 2,000-5,000 MUR. Hindu guests often present gold jewelry or household items matching the cash value, while Muslim guests strictly give money in decorated envelopes during <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-walima-6389"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/AR-MU_walima.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="walima - click to hear pronunciation" lang="AR"><strong class="term-text">walima</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">wah-LEE-mah</span></span></span></dfn></strong> receptions. Chinese <strong>hongbao</strong> traditions dictate even-numbered amounts (avoiding 4) ranging from 2,000-20,000 MUR in red envelopes. Christian weddings see mixed practices with 40% using gift registries (uncommon in other communities) for appliances and home goods. Rural communities practice collective gifting where extended families pool resources for substantial presents like furniture sets worth 50,000-100,000 MUR. Post-COVID, digital transfers increased by 60%, though physical envelope presentation during ceremonies remains culturally important.</p>
                <h3>What are typical catering options and costs per guest?</h3>
                <p>Catering costs range from 500-1,500 MUR ($11-33 USD) per guest depending on menu complexity and service style. Hindu vegetarian options featuring seven curries, rice, breads, and sweets average 500-800 MUR, while non-vegetarian menus with meat curries increase to 800-1,200 MUR. Muslim <strong><dfn class="term-wrapper" id="def-biryani-7340"><span class="audio-term" data-audio="https://cdn.everafter.com/traditions/pronunciations/UR-MU_biryani.mp3" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="biryani - click to hear pronunciation" lang="UR"><strong class="term-text">biryani</strong><span class="pronunciation-info"><span class="phonetic">bir-YAH-nee</span></span></span></dfn></strong> feasts including lamb or chicken biryani, kababs, and multiple sides cost 1,000-1,500 MUR per person. Chinese-influenced menus incorporating seafood and specialized dishes reach 1,200-1,800 MUR. Buffet service reduces costs by 20% compared to plated meals, while traditional banana leaf service (Hindu) or communal platters (Muslim) offer authentic experiences. Modern fusion menus blending Mauritian-international cuisines command premium prices of 1,500-2,000 MUR. Dessert stations add 200-400 MUR per guest, while beverage packages (excluding Muslim events) range from 200-500 MUR for standard selections.</p>
                <h3>When should international guests arrive for a Mauritian wedding?</h3>
                <p>International guests should arrive 2-3 days before the main ceremony to participate in pre-wedding celebrations like <strong>mehendi</strong> and <strong>sangeet</strong>, which offer intimate cultural experiences beyond the formal wedding. Direct flights from Europe, Asia, and Africa make Mauritius accessible, with peak wedding season (May-December) requiring advance booking. Hotels near wedding venues offer group rates averaging 3,000-8,000 MUR per night, with 70% of couples arranging transportation for international guests. Early arrival allows acclimatization to tropical weather and time zone adjustment (GMT+4). Visa-free entry for many nationalities simplifies planning, though checking requirements remains essential. Extended stays combining wedding attendance with island tourism are common, with 60% of international guests spending 7-10 days exploring beaches and cultural sites. Wedding invitations typically include suggested arrival dates and local contact information for coordination.</p>
                <h3>How do couples choose between traditional and beach wedding venues?</h3>
                <p>Venue selection depends on religious requirements, with 90% of Hindu ceremonies requiring <strong>mandap</strong> structures feasible at hotels or gardens, while 70% of Christian couples opt for beach ceremonies since
                2021. Beach venues cost 300,000-500,000 MUR including permits (50,000 MUR), setup, and weather contingencies, compared to traditional halls at 100,000-300,000 MUR. Religious considerations influence choices: Hindu fire rituals need wind protection, Muslim ceremonies require prayer facilities, while Chinese tea ceremonies favor indoor settings. Modern couples (60% urban) choose beaches for photogenic backdrops and tourist guest convenience, despite 20% higher catering costs due to logistics. Weather concerns (November-April cyclone season) necessitate backup plans adding 100,000 MUR to budgets. Traditional venues offer cultural authenticity with established vendor relationships, while beaches provide unique experiences attracting younger couples prioritizing aesthetics over convenience.</p>

                I had a surprise wedding at Ever After Wedding Chapel, and honestly it was <span class="highlight">one of the best days of my life</span>. My husband (!!!) worked with their team to plan everything, and they did wonderfully. They remembered every little detail about me, made sure the atmosphere was perfect and kept everything fun, warm and full of love. Plus, they're real dad joke masters, and that's the real reason I knew I was in good hands. (Really, they're authentic when it comes to love and laughter). If you're thinking about getting married in Las Vegas, don't think twice and book with them. They made our day unforgettable, and I'm still smiling like I caught the bouquet.

                Ever After gave us such a wonderful wedding day experience! They have <span class="highlight">very attentive staff who accompanied us every step of the way</span>, from the moment we made the deposit to reserve the date, to the "I do." We, like many others, traveled to Las Vegas to get married from out of state, so we didn't visit the chapel until the wedding day, which can be a bit stressful. When we arrived, all the staff took very good care of us and our guests. The staff was very kind! They kept me separated from the groom until it was time for the ceremony. The serenity room we reserved was so lovely! I'm obsessed with my bridal bouquet, they customized it for me and I was able to take it home on the plane. The photos from the photo session came out phenomenal, very professional and high quality. The photos came out so well that we ended up buying them all haha. Vegas has a ridiculous amount of chapels, but look no further, this place is the one. The exterior of the building doesn't look cheap or ghetto, like some of the other nearby chapels, the transportation was punctual and the limousine was clean and the driver very professional. But most of all, the constant communication and answering all our questions definitely put us at ease. They gave me the wedding I had imagined 🥹 I have no complaints A+++

                We couldn't be happier with our experience at Ever After Wedding Chapel! We used their Sign and Go service, and from start to finish, it was <span class="highlight">a smooth, stress-free process in less than 15 minutes</span>. Yes, you read that right! The team was professional, kind, and efficient, making the whole process special despite its simplicity. It was just what we were looking for: no frills, just a beautiful moment to seal the deal. And for the price? Absolutely unbeatable. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and meaningful way to say "I do," this is the place. I highly recommend it to any couple who wants a quick, hassle-free wedding without sacrificing professionalism or charm. Thank you, Andrea and Ever After Wedding Chapel, for making our day so easy and memorable! 💍✨

                Tony and Allison are a fantastic team! My sister and I planned our parents' wedding in Las Vegas after 22 years together. At 70 and 75 years old, <span class="highlight">our parents were treated like royalty at Ever After</span>. Ever After now has a new location and it's the perfect setting for a wedding. We are very satisfied with the planning and execution of the big day. I recommend all brides to hire the hair and makeup package, as they pick you up and drop you off in advance, and it's worth the worry-free experience. The whole experience was lovely and I would recommend Tony to anyone who wants to get married in Las Vegas.

                Allison and Tony were some of the nicest, kindest and most welcoming people we've met in a long time. <span class="highlight">They made our day more special than we could have imagined</span> and I wouldn't have changed anything about that day. Having them perform our ceremony will be part of our wedding day memories for years to come. Allison officiating the ceremony was incredible, it seemed like she already knew us and the words used fit perfectly when we joined in Holy matrimony. I can't forget about Tony, he took the best photos and captured the moment perfectly!

                Where to start! We traveled to Las Vegas from Scotland and booked Ever After Chapel before arriving. We arrived just before our wedding; it was just the two of us, but Jen and Tony were fantastic. They offered us water on arrival, we chatted and told them some details about how we met, etc. I was able to choose a bouquet from a fantastic selection; we were the only couple in the chapel and the door was closed, so it was just us, which was great ❤️ <span class="highlight">Tony was fantastic; he made our vows very personal and we didn't feel rushed</span>. Jen took us some photos in the chapel and outside; she was fantastic making us feel comfortable. They sent them to us right after the ceremony so we could print them whenever we wanted. Honestly, the whole experience, from start to finish, was fantastic. Thank you so much Tony and Jen for making our day so special! ❤️
